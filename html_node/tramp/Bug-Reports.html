<h2 class="chapter">7 Reporting Bugs and Problems</h2>

<p><a name="index-bug-reports-261"></a>
<span class="sc">Tramp</span>'s development team is actively engaged in solving bugs
and problems and looks to feature requests and suggestions.

   <p><span class="sc">Tramp</span>'s mailing list is the place for more advice and
information on working with <span class="sc">Tramp</span>, solving problems,
discussing, and general discussions about <span class="sc">Tramp</span>.

   <p><span class="sc">Tramp</span>'s mailing list is moderated but even non-subscribers can
post for moderator approval.  Sometimes this approval step may take as
long as 48 hours due to public holidays.

   <p><a href="mailto:tramp-devel@gnu.org">tramp-devel@gnu.org</a> is the mailing list.  Messages sent to
this address go to all the subscribers.  This is <em>not</em> the
address to send subscription requests to.

   <p>To subscribe to the mailing list, visit:
<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/tramp-devel/">the <span class="sc">Tramp</span> Mail Subscription Page</a>.

   <p><a name="index-tramp_002dbug-262"></a>Check if the bug or problem is already addressed in See <a href="Frequently-Asked-Questions.html#Frequently-Asked-Questions">Frequently Asked Questions</a>.

   <p>Run <kbd>M-x tramp-bug &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> to generate a buffer with details of
the system along with the details of the <span class="sc">Tramp</span> installation. 
Please include these details with the bug report.

   <p>The bug report must describe in as excruciating detail as possible the
steps required to reproduce the problem.  These details must include
the setup of the remote host and any special or unique conditions that
exist.

   <p>Include a minimal test case that reproduces the problem.  This will
help the development team find the best solution and avoid unrelated
detours.

   <p>To exclude cache-related problems, flush all caches before running the
test, <a href="Cleanup-remote-connections.html#Cleanup-remote-connections">Cleanup remote connections</a>.

   <p>When including <span class="sc">Tramp</span>'s messages in the bug report, increase
the verbosity level to 6 (see <a href="Traces-and-Profiles.html#Traces-and-Profiles">Traces</a>) in the
<samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> file before repeating steps to the bug.  Include the
contents of the <samp><span class="file">*tramp/foo*</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">*debug tramp/foo*</span></samp>
buffers with the bug report.

   <p><strong>Note</strong> that a verbosity level greater than 6 is not necessary
at this stage.  Also note that a verbosity level of 6 or greater, the
contents of files and directories will be included in the debug
buffer.  Passwords typed in <span class="sc">Tramp</span> will never be included
there.
