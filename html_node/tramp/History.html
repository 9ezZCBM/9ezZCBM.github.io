<h2 class="chapter">3 History of <span class="sc">Tramp</span></h2>

<p><a name="index-history-6"></a><a name="index-development-history-7"></a>
<span class="sc">Tramp</span> development started at the end of November 1998 as
<samp><span class="file">rssh.el</span></samp>.  It provided only one method of access.  It used
<samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> for login and <samp><span class="command">scp</span></samp> to transfer file contents. 
The name was changed to <samp><span class="file">rcp.el</span></samp> before it got its present name
<span class="sc">Tramp</span>.  New methods of remote access were added, so was support
for version control.

   <p>April 2000 was the first time when multi-hop methods were added.  In
July 2002, <span class="sc">Tramp</span> unified file names with Ange FTP.  In July
2004, proxy hosts replaced multi-hop methods.  Running commands on
remote hosts was introduced in December 2005.  Support for gateways
since April 2007 (and removed in December 2016).  GVFS integration
started in February 2009.  Remote commands on MS Windows hosts since
September 2011.  Ad-hoc multi-hop methods (with a changed syntax)
re-enabled in November 2011.  In November 2012, added Juergen
Hoetzel's <samp><span class="file">tramp-adb.el</span></samp>.

   <p>XEmacs support was stopped in January 2016.  Since March 2017,
<span class="sc">Tramp</span> syntax mandates a method.
