<h3 class="section">5.1 Types of connections to remote hosts</h3>

<p><a name="index-connection-types_002c-overview-42"></a>
<dfn>Inline method</dfn> and <dfn>external method</dfn> are the two basic types
of access methods.  While they both use the same remote shell access
programs, such as <samp><span class="command">rsh</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="command">telnet</span></samp>,
they differ in the file access methods.  Choosing the right method
becomes important for editing files, transferring large files, or
operating on a large number of files.

   <p>The performance of the external methods is generally better than that
of the inline methods, at least for large files.  This is caused by
the need to encode and decode the data when transferring inline.

   <p>The one exception to this rule are the <samp><span class="option">scp</span></samp>-based access
methods.  While these methods do see better performance when actually
transferring files, the overhead of the cryptographic negotiation at
startup may drown out the improvement in file transfer times.

   <p>External methods should be configured such a way that they don't
require a password (with <samp><span class="command">ssh-agent</span></samp>, or such alike).  Modern
<samp><span class="command">scp</span></samp> implementations offer options to reuse existing
<samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> connections, which will be enabled by default if
available.  If it isn't possible, you should consider <a href="Password-handling.html#Password-handling">Password handling</a>, otherwise you will be prompted for a password every copy
action.
