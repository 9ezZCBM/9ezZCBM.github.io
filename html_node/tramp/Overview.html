<h2 class="chapter">1 An overview of <span class="sc">Tramp</span></h2>

<p><a name="index-overview-1"></a>
<span class="sc">Tramp</span> is for transparently accessing remote files from within
Emacs.  <span class="sc">Tramp</span> enables an easy, convenient, and consistent
interface to remote files as if they are local files.  <span class="sc">Tramp</span>'s
transparency extends to editing, version control, and <code>dired</code>.

   <p><span class="sc">Tramp</span> can access remote hosts using any number of access
methods, such as <samp><span class="command">rsh</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">rlogin</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">telnet</span></samp>,
and related programs.  If these programs can successfully pass
<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters, <span class="sc">Tramp</span> can use them. 
<span class="sc">Tramp</span> does not require or mandate 8-bit clean connections.

   <p><span class="sc">Tramp</span>'s most common access method is through <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp>, a
more secure alternative to <samp><span class="command">ftp</span></samp> and other older access
methods.

   <p><span class="sc">Tramp</span> on MS Windows operating systems is integrated with the
PuTTY package, and uses the <samp><span class="command">plink</span></samp> program.

   <p><span class="sc">Tramp</span> mostly operates transparently in the background using
the connection programs.  As long as these programs enable remote login
and can use the terminal, <span class="sc">Tramp</span> can adapt them for seamless
and transparent access.

   <p><span class="sc">Tramp</span> temporarily transfers a remote file's contents to the
local host editing and related operations.  <span class="sc">Tramp</span> can also
transfer files between hosts using standard Emacs interfaces, a
benefit of direct integration of <span class="sc">Tramp</span> in Emacs.

   <p><span class="sc">Tramp</span> can transfer files using any number of available host
programs for remote files, such as <samp><span class="command">rcp</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">scp</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="command">rsync</span></samp> or (under MS Windows) <samp><span class="command">pscp</span></samp>.  <span class="sc">Tramp</span>
provides easy ways to specify these programs and customize them to
specific files, hosts, or access methods.

   <p>For faster small-size file transfers, <span class="sc">Tramp</span> supports encoded
transfers directly through the shell using <samp><span class="command">mimencode</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="command">uuencode</span></samp> provided such tools are available on the remote
host.

<h5 class="subsubheading"><span class="sc">Tramp</span> behind the scenes</h5>

<p><a name="index-behind-the-scenes-2"></a><a name="index-details-of-operation-3"></a><a name="index-how-it-works-4"></a>
Accessing a remote file through <span class="sc">Tramp</span> entails a series of
actions, many of which are transparent to the user.  Yet some actions
may require user response (such as entering passwords or completing
file names).  One typical scenario, opening a file on a remote host, is
presented here to illustrate the steps involved:

   <p><kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> to initiate find-file, enter part of the <span class="sc">Tramp</span>
file name, then hit <kbd>&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> for completion.  If this is the
first time connection to that host, here's what happens:

     <ul>
<li><span class="sc">Tramp</span> invokes &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">telnet </span><var>host</var></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rsh </span><var>host</var><span class="samp">
-l </span><var>user</var></samp>&rsquo; and establishes an external process to connect to the
remote host.  <span class="sc">Tramp</span> communicates with the process through an
Emacs buffer, which also shows output from the remote host.

     <li>The remote host may prompt for a login name (for <samp><span class="command">telnet</span></samp>, for
example) in the buffer.  If on the other hand, the login name was
included in the file name portion, <span class="sc">Tramp</span> sends the login name
followed by a newline.

     <li>The remote host may then prompt for a password or pass phrase (for
<samp><span class="command">rsh</span></samp> or for <samp><span class="command">telnet</span></samp>).  <span class="sc">Tramp</span> displays the
password prompt in the minibuffer.  <span class="sc">Tramp</span> then sends whatever
is entered to the remote host, followed by a newline.

     <li><span class="sc">Tramp</span> now waits for either the shell prompt or a failed login
message.

     <p>If <span class="sc">Tramp</span> does not receive any messages within a timeout period
(a minute, for example), then <span class="sc">Tramp</span> responds with an error
message about not finding the remote shell prompt.  If any messages
from the remote host, <span class="sc">Tramp</span> displays them in the buffer.

     <p>For any &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">login failed</span></samp>&rsquo; message from the remote host,
<span class="sc">Tramp</span> aborts the login attempt, and repeats the login steps
again.

     <li>Upon successful login and <span class="sc">Tramp</span> recognizes the shell prompt
from the remote host, <span class="sc">Tramp</span> prepares the shell environment by
turning off echoing, setting shell prompt, and other housekeeping
chores.

     <p><strong>Note</strong> that for the remote shell, <span class="sc">Tramp</span> invokes
<samp><span class="command">/bin/sh</span></samp>.  The remote host must recognize &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">exec /bin/sh</span></samp>&rsquo;
and execute the appropriate shell.  This shell must support Bourne
shell syntax.

     <li><span class="sc">Tramp</span> executes <samp><span class="command">cd</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp> commands to find
which files exist on the remote host.  <span class="sc">Tramp</span> sometimes uses
<samp><span class="command">echo</span></samp> with globbing.  <span class="sc">Tramp</span> checks if a file or
directory is writable with <samp><span class="command">test</span></samp>.  After each command,
<span class="sc">Tramp</span> parses the output from the remote host for completing
the next operation.

     <li>After remote file name completion, <span class="sc">Tramp</span> transfers the file
contents from the remote host.

     <p>For inline transfers, <span class="sc">Tramp</span> sends a command, such as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mimencode -b /path/to/remote/file</span></samp>&rsquo;, waits until the output has
accumulated in the buffer, decodes that output to produce the file's
contents.

     <p>For external transfers, <span class="sc">Tramp</span> sends a command as follows:
     <pre class="example">          rcp user@host:/path/to/remote/file /tmp/tramp.4711
</pre>
     <p><span class="sc">Tramp</span> reads the local temporary file <samp><span class="file">/tmp/tramp.4711</span></samp>
into a buffer, and then deletes the temporary file.

     <li>Edit, modify, change the buffer contents as normal, and then save the
buffer with <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd>.

     <li><span class="sc">Tramp</span> transfers the buffer contents to the remote host in
a reverse of the process using the appropriate inline or external
program. 
</ul>

   <p>I hope this has provided you with a basic overview of what happens
behind the scenes when you open a file with <span class="sc">Tramp</span>.
