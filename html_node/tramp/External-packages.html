<h3 class="section">9.2 Integrating with external Lisp packages</h3>

<h4 class="subsection">9.2.1 File name completion.</h4>

<p>Sometimes, it is not convenient to open a new connection to a remote
host, including entering the password and alike.  For example, this is
nasty for packages providing file name completion. Such a package
could signal to <span class="sc">Tramp</span>, that they don't want it to establish a
new connection.  Use the variable <code>non-essential</code> temporarily and
bind it to non-<code>nil</code> value.

<pre class="lisp">     (let ((non-essential t))
       ...)
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">9.2.2 File attributes cache.</h4>

<p>Keeping a local cache of remote file attributes in sync with the
remote host is a time-consuming operation.  Flushing and re-querying
these attributes can tax <span class="sc">Tramp</span> to a grinding halt on busy
remote servers.

   <p>To get around these types of slow-downs in <span class="sc">Tramp</span>'s
responsiveness, set the <code>process-file-side-effects</code> to <code>nil</code>
to stop <span class="sc">Tramp</span> from flushing the cache.  This is helpful in
situations where callers to <code>process-file</code> know there are no file
attribute changes.  The let-bind form to accomplish this:

<pre class="lisp">     (let (process-file-side-effects)
       ...)
</pre>
   <p>For asynchronous processes, <span class="sc">Tramp</span> uses a process sentinel to
flush file attributes cache.  When callers to <code>start-file-process</code>
know beforehand no file attribute changes are expected, then the
process sentinel should be set to the default state.  In cases where
the caller defines its own process sentinel, <span class="sc">Tramp</span>'s process
sentinel is overwritten.  The caller can still flush the file
attributes cache in its process sentinel with this code:

<pre class="lisp">     (unless (memq (process-status proc) '(run open))
       (dired-uncache remote-directory))
</pre>
   <p>Since <span class="sc">Tramp</span> traverses subdirectories starting with the
root-directory, it is most likely sufficient to make the
<code>default-directory</code> of the process buffer as the root directory.
