<h3 class="section">5.4 GVFS based external methods</h3>

<p><a name="index-methods_002c-gvfs-125"></a><a name="index-gvfs-based-methods-126"></a><a name="index-dbus-127"></a>
GVFS is the virtual file system for the Gnome Desktop,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GVFS">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GVFS</a>.  Remote files on GVFS are
mounted locally through FUSE and <span class="sc">Tramp</span> uses this locally
mounted directory internally.

   <p>Emacs uses the D-Bus mechanism to communicate with GVFS.  Emacs must
have the message bus system, D-Bus integration active, see <a href="../dbus/index.html#Top">D-Bus</a>.

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="option">afp</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-afp-128"></a><a name="index-afp-method-129"></a>
This method is for connecting to remote hosts with the Apple Filing
Protocol for accessing files on macOS volumes.  <span class="sc">Tramp</span> access
syntax requires a leading volume (share) name, for example:
<samp><span class="file">/afp:user@host:/volume</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">dav</span></samp><br><dt><samp><span class="option">davs</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-dav-130"></a><a name="index-method-davs-131"></a><a name="index-dav-method-132"></a><a name="index-davs-method-133"></a>
<samp><span class="option">dav</span></samp> method provides access to WebDAV files and directories
based on standard protocols, such as HTTP.  <samp><span class="option">davs</span></samp> does the same
but with SSL encryption.  Both methods support the port numbers.

     <p>Paths being part of the WebDAV volume to be mounted by GVFS, as it is
common for OwnCloud or NextCloud file names, are not supported by
these methods.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">gdrive</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-gdrive-134"></a><a name="index-gdrive-method-135"></a><a name="index-google-drive-136"></a>
Via the <samp><span class="option">gdrive</span></samp> method it is possible to access your Google
Drive online storage.  User and host name of the remote file name are
your email address of the Google Drive credentials, like
<samp><span class="file">/gdrive:john.doe@gmail.com:/</span></samp>.  These credentials must
be populated in your <samp><span class="command">Online Accounts</span></samp> application outside Emacs.

     <p>Since Google Drive uses cryptic blob file names internally,
<span class="sc">Tramp</span> works with the <code>display-name</code> of the files.  This
could produce unexpected behavior in case two files in the same
directory have the same <code>display-name</code>, such a situation must be avoided.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">obex</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-obex-137"></a><a name="index-obex-method-138"></a>
OBEX is an FTP-like access protocol for cell phones and similar simple
devices.  <span class="sc">Tramp</span> supports OBEX over Bluetooth.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">sftp</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-sftp-139"></a><a name="index-sftp-method-140"></a>
This method uses <samp><span class="command">sftp</span></samp> in order to securely access remote
hosts.  <samp><span class="command">sftp</span></samp> is a more secure option for connecting to hosts
that for security reasons refuse <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> connections.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">synce</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-synce-141"></a><a name="index-synce-method-142"></a>
<samp><span class="option">synce</span></samp> method allows connecting to MS Windows Mobile devices. 
It uses GVFS for mounting remote files and directories via FUSE and
requires the SYNCE-GVFS plugin.
