<h2 class="appendix">Appendix B Common Lisp Compatibility</h2>

<p class="noindent">The following is a list of some of the most important
incompatibilities between this package and Common Lisp as documented
in Steele (2nd edition).

   <p>The word <code>cl-defun</code> is required instead of <code>defun</code> in order
to use extended Common Lisp argument lists in a function.  Likewise,
<code>cl-defmacro</code> and <code>cl-function</code> are versions of those forms
which understand full-featured argument lists.  The <code>&amp;whole</code>
keyword does not work in <code>cl-defmacro</code> argument lists (except
inside recursive argument lists).

   <p>The <code>equal</code> predicate does not distinguish
between IEEE floating-point plus and minus zero.  The <code>cl-equalp</code>
predicate has several differences with Common Lisp; see <a href="Predicates.html#Predicates">Predicates</a>.

   <p>The <code>cl-do-all-symbols</code> form is the same as <code>cl-do-symbols</code>
with no <var>obarray</var> argument.  In Common Lisp, this form would
iterate over all symbols in all packages.  Since Emacs obarrays
are not a first-class package mechanism, there is no way for
<code>cl-do-all-symbols</code> to locate any but the default obarray.

   <p>The <code>cl-loop</code> macro is complete except that <code>loop-finish</code>
and type specifiers are unimplemented.

   <p>The multiple-value return facility treats lists as multiple
values, since Emacs Lisp cannot support multiple return values
directly.  The macros will be compatible with Common Lisp if
<code>cl-values</code> or <code>cl-values-list</code> is always used to return to
a <code>cl-multiple-value-bind</code> or other multiple-value receiver;
if <code>cl-values</code> is used without <code>cl-multiple-value-...</code>
or vice-versa the effect will be different from Common Lisp.

   <p>Many Common Lisp declarations are ignored, and others match
the Common Lisp standard in concept but not in detail.  For
example, local <code>special</code> declarations, which are purely
advisory in Emacs Lisp, do not rigorously obey the scoping rules
set down in Steele's book.

   <p>The variable <code>cl--gensym-counter</code> starts out with zero.

   <p>The <code>cl-defstruct</code> facility is compatible, except that the
<code>:type</code> slot option is ignored.

   <p>The second argument of <code>cl-check-type</code> is treated differently.
