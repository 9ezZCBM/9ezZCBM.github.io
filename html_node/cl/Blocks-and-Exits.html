<h3 class="section">4.5 Blocks and Exits</h3>

<p><a name="index-block-42"></a><a name="index-exit-43"></a>
Common Lisp <dfn>blocks</dfn> provide a non-local exit mechanism very
similar to <code>catch</code> and <code>throw</code>, with lexical scoping. 
This package actually implements <code>cl-block</code>
in terms of <code>catch</code>; however, the lexical scoping allows the
byte-compiler to omit the costly <code>catch</code> step if the
body of the block does not actually <code>cl-return-from</code> the block.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>cl-block</b><var> name forms<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-cl_002dblock-44"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The <var>forms</var> are evaluated as if by a <code>progn</code>.  However,
if any of the <var>forms</var> execute <code>(cl-return-from </code><var>name</var><code>)</code>,
they will jump out and return directly from the <code>cl-block</code> form. 
The <code>cl-block</code> returns the result of the last <var>form</var> unless
a <code>cl-return-from</code> occurs.

        <p>The <code>cl-block</code>/<code>cl-return-from</code> mechanism is quite similar to
the <code>catch</code>/<code>throw</code> mechanism.  The main differences are
that block <var>name</var>s are unevaluated symbols, rather than forms
(such as quoted symbols) that evaluate to a tag at run-time; and
also that blocks are always lexically scoped. 
In a dynamically scoped <code>catch</code>, functions called from the
<code>catch</code> body can also <code>throw</code> to the <code>catch</code>.  This
is not an option for <code>cl-block</code>, where
the <code>cl-return-from</code> referring to a block name must appear
physically within the <var>forms</var> that make up the body of the block. 
They may not appear within other called functions, although they may
appear within macro expansions or <code>lambda</code>s in the body.  Block
names and <code>catch</code> names form independent name-spaces.

        <p>In true Common Lisp, <code>defun</code> and <code>defmacro</code> surround
the function or expander bodies with implicit blocks with the
same name as the function or macro.  This does not occur in Emacs
Lisp, but this package provides <code>cl-defun</code> and <code>cl-defmacro</code>
forms, which do create the implicit block.

        <p>The Common Lisp looping constructs defined by this package,
such as <code>cl-loop</code> and <code>cl-dolist</code>, also create implicit blocks
just as in Common Lisp.

        <p>Because they are implemented in terms of Emacs Lisp's <code>catch</code>
and <code>throw</code>, blocks have the same overhead as actual
<code>catch</code> constructs (roughly two function calls).  However,
the byte compiler will optimize away the <code>catch</code>
if the block does
not in fact contain any <code>cl-return</code> or <code>cl-return-from</code> calls
that jump to it.  This means that <code>cl-do</code> loops and <code>cl-defun</code>
functions that don't use <code>cl-return</code> don't pay the overhead to
support it.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>cl-return-from</b><var> name </var>[<var>result</var>]<var><a name="index-cl_002dreturn_002dfrom-45"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This macro returns from the block named <var>name</var>, which must be
an (unevaluated) symbol.  If a <var>result</var> form is specified, it
is evaluated to produce the result returned from the <code>block</code>. 
Otherwise, <code>nil</code> is returned. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>cl-return</b> [<var>result</var>]<var><a name="index-cl_002dreturn-46"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This macro is exactly like <code>(cl-return-from nil </code><var>result</var><code>)</code>. 
Common Lisp loops like <code>cl-do</code> and <code>cl-dolist</code> implicitly enclose
themselves in <code>nil</code> blocks. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<!-- FIXME?  Maybe this should be in a separate section? -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>cl-tagbody</b><var> &amp;rest labels-or-statements<a name="index-cl_002dtagbody-47"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This macro executes statements while allowing for control transfer to
user-defined labels.  Each element of <var>labels-or-statements</var> can
be either a label (an integer or a symbol), or a cons-cell
(a statement).  This distinction is made before macroexpansion. 
Statements are executed in sequence, discarding any return value. 
Any statement can transfer control at any time to the statements that follow
one of the labels with the special form <code>(go </code><var>label</var><code>)</code>. 
Labels have lexical scope and dynamic extent.
