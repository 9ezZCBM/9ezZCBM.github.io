<h3 class="section">4.6 Resolving Routines</h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bRESOLVE_005fROUTINE_007d-174"></a><a name="index-Compiling-library-modules-175"></a><a name="index-Routines_002c-resolving-176"></a>
The key sequence <kbd>C-c =</kbd> calls the command <code>idlwave-resolve</code>
and sends the line &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">RESOLVE_ROUTINE, '</span><var>routine_name</var><span class="samp">'</span></samp>&rsquo; to IDL
in order to resolve (compile) it.  The default routine to be resolved is
taken from context, but you get a chance to edit it.  Usually this is
not necessary, since IDL automatically discovers routines on its path.

   <p><code>idlwave-resolve</code> is one way to get a library module within reach
of IDLWAVE's routine info collecting functions.  A better way is to
keep routine information available in catalogs (see <a href="Catalogs.html#Catalogs">Catalogs</a>). 
Routine info on modules will then be available without the need to
compile the modules first, and even without a running shell.

   <p>See <a href="Sources-of-Routine-Info.html#Sources-of-Routine-Info">Sources of Routine Info</a>, for more information on the ways IDLWAVE
collects data about routines, and how to update this information.
