The many debugging, compiling, and examination commands provided in
IDLWAVE are available simultaneously through two different interfaces:
the original, multi-key command interface, and the new Electric Debug
Mode.  The functionality they offer is similar, but the way you interact
with them is quite different.  The main difference is that, in Electric
Debug Mode, the source buffers are made read-only, and single
key-strokes are used to step through, examine expressions, set and
remove breakpoints, etc.  The same variables, prefix arguments, and
settings apply to both versions, and both can be used interchangeably. 
By default, when breakpoints are hit, Electric Debug Mode is enabled. 
The traditional interface is described first.  See <a href="Electric-Debug-Mode.html#Electric-Debug-Mode">Electric Debug Mode</a>, for more on that mode.  Note that electric debug mode can be
prevented from activating automatically by customizing the variable
<code>idlwave-shell-automatic-electric-debug</code>.
