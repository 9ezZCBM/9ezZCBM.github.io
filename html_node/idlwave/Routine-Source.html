<p><a name="index-Routine-source-file-168"></a><a name="index-Module-source-file-169"></a><a name="index-Source-file_002c-of-a-routine-170"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dv-171"></a>In addition to clicking on a <i>Source:</i> line in the routine info
window, there is another way to quickly visit the source file of a
routine.  The command <kbd>C-c C-v</kbd> (<code>idlwave-find-module</code>) asks
for a module name, offering the same default as
<code>idlwave-routine-info</code> would have used, taken from nearby buffer
contents.  In the minibuffer, specify a complete routine name (including
any class part).  IDLWAVE will display the source file in another
window, positioned at the routine in question.  You can also limit this
to a routine in the current buffer only, with completion, and a
context-sensitive default, by using a single prefix (<kbd>C-u C-c C-v</kbd>)
or the convenience binding <kbd>C-c C-t</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-Buffers_002c-killing-172"></a><a name="index-Killing-autoloaded-buffers-173"></a>Since getting the source of a routine into a buffer is so easy with
IDLWAVE, too many buffers visiting different IDL source files are
sometimes created.  The special command <kbd>C-c C-k</kbd>
(<code>idlwave-kill-autoloaded-buffers</code>) can be used to easily remove
these buffers.
