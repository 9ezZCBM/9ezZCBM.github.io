<h3 class="section">5.6 Custom Expression Examination</h3>

<p><a name="index-Expressions_002c-custom-examination-332"></a><a name="index-Custom-expression-examination-333"></a>
The variety of possible variable and expression examination commands is
endless (just look, for instance, at the keyword list to
<code>widget_info()</code>).  Rather than attempt to include them all, IDLWAVE
provides two easy methods to customize your own commands, with a special
mouse examine command, and two macros for generating your own examine
key and mouse bindings.

   <p>The most powerful and flexible mouse examine command of all is
available on <kbd>C-S-mouse-2</kbd>.  Just as for all the other mouse
examine commands, it permits click or drag expression selection, but
instead of sending hard-coded commands to the shell, it pops-up a
customizable selection list of examine functions to choose among,
configured with the <code>idlwave-shell-examine-alist</code>
variable<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  This variable is a list of key-value pairs (an
<em>alist</em> in Emacs parlance), where the key gives a name to be
shown for the examine command, and the value is the command strings
itself, in which the text <code>___</code> (three underscores) will be
replaced by the selected expression before being sent to the shell. 
An example might be key <code>Structure Help</code> with value
<code>help,___,/STRUCTURE</code>.  In that case, you'd be prompted with
<em>Structure Help</em>, which might send something like
<code>help,var,/STRUCTURE</code> to the shell for output. 
<code>idlwave-shell-examine-alist</code> comes configured by default with a
large list of examine commands, but you can easily customize it to add
your own.

   <p>In addition to configuring the functions available to the pop-up mouse
command, you can easily create your own customized bindings to inspect
expressions using the two convenience macros
<code>idlwave-shell-examine</code> and <code>idlwave-shell-mouse-examine</code>. 
These create keyboard or mouse-based custom inspections of variables,
sharing all the same properties of the built-in examine commands. 
Both functions take a single string argument sharing the syntax of the
<code>idlwave-shell-examine-alist</code> values, e.g.:

<pre class="lisp">     (add-hook 'idlwave-shell-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (idlwave-shell-define-key-both [s-down-mouse-2]
                                      (idlwave-shell-mouse-examine
                                       "print, size(___,/DIMENSIONS)"))
                 (idlwave-shell-define-key-both [f9] (idlwave-shell-examine
                                            "print, size(___,/DIMENSIONS)"))
                 (idlwave-shell-define-key-both [f10] (idlwave-shell-examine
                                             "print,size(___,/TNAME)"))
                 (idlwave-shell-define-key-both [f11] (idlwave-shell-examine
                                             "help,___,/STRUCTURE"))))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Now pressing &lt;f9&gt;, or middle-mouse dragging with the
&lt;SUPER&gt; key depressed, will print the dimensions of the nearby or
highlighted expression.  Pressing &lt;f10&gt; will give the type string,
and &lt;f11&gt; will show the contents of a nearby structure.  As you can
see, the possibilities are only marginally finite.
