<h2 class="appendix">Appendix B HTML Help Browser Tips</h2>

<p><a name="index-Browser-Tips-388"></a>
There are a wide variety of possible browsers to use for displaying
the online HTML help available with IDLWAVE (starting with version
5.0). Since IDL v6.2, a single cross-platform HTML help browser, the
<em>IDL Assistant</em> is distributed with IDL.  If this help browser is
available, it is the preferred choice, and the default.  The variable
<code>idlwave-help-use-assistant</code>, enabled by default, controls
whether this help browser is used.  If you use the IDL Assistant, the
tips here are not relevant.

   <p>Since IDLWAVE runs on many different system types, a single browser
configuration is not possible, but choices abound.  The default
<code>idlwave-help-browser-function</code> inherits the browser configured
in <code>browse-url-browser-function</code>.

   <p>Note that the HTML files decompiled from the help sources contain
specific references to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Symbol</span></samp>&rsquo; font, which by default is not
permitted in normal encodings (it's invalid, technically).  Though it
only impacts a few symbols, you can trick Mozilla-based browsers into
recognizing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Symbol</span></samp>&rsquo; by following the directions
<!-- This page is 11 years old.  Is it still relevant? -->
<a href="http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth/Xfonts.html">here</a>.  With
this fix in place, HTML help pages look almost identical to their PDF
equivalents (yet can be bookmarked, browsed as history, searched,
etc.).
