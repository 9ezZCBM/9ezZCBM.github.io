<strong>Starting with version 6.2, IDL is distributed directly with HTML
online help, and an XML-based catalog of routine information</strong>.  This
makes scanning the manuals with the tool <samp><span class="file">get_html_rinfo</span></samp>, and the
<samp><span class="file">idlw-rinfo.el</span></samp> file it produced, as described here, entirely
unnecessary.  The information is left here for users wishing to produce
a catalog of older IDL versions' help.

   <p>IDLWAVE derives its knowledge about system routines from the IDL
manuals.  The file <samp><span class="file">idlw-rinfo.el</span></samp> contains the routine information
for the IDL system routines, and links to relevant sections of the HTML
documentation.  The Online Help feature of IDLWAVE requires HTML
versions of the IDL manuals to be available; the HTML documentation is
not distributed with IDLWAVE by default, but must be downloaded
separately.

   <p>The HTML files and related images can be produced from the
<samp><span class="file">idl.chm</span></samp> HTMLHelp file distributed with IDL using the free
Microsoft HTML Help Workshop.  If you are lucky, the maintainer of
IDLWAVE will always have access to the newest version of IDL and provide
updates.  The IDLWAVE distribution also contains the Perl program
<samp><span class="file">get_html_rinfo</span></samp> which constructs the <samp><span class="file">idlw-rinfo.el</span></samp> file by
scanning the HTML documents produced from the IDL documentation. 
Instructions on how to use <samp><span class="file">get_html_rinfo</span></samp> are in the program
itself.
