<h3 class="section">4.9 Actions</h3>

<p><a name="index-Actions-182"></a><a name="index-Coding-standards_002c-enforcing-183"></a>
<em>Actions</em> are special formatting commands which are executed
automatically while you write code in order to check the structure of
the program or to enforce coding standards.  Most actions which have
been implemented in IDLWAVE are turned off by default, assuming that the
average user wants her code the way she writes it.  But if you are a
lazy typist and want your code to adhere to certain standards, actions
can be helpful.

   <p>Actions can be applied in three ways:

     <ul>
<li>Some actions are applied directly while typing.  For example, pressing
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo; can run a check to make sure that this operator is surrounded
by spaces and insert these spaces if necessary.  Pressing &lt;SPC&gt;
after a reserved word can call a command to change the word to upper
case. 
<li>When a line is re-indented with &lt;TAB&gt;, actions can be applied to the
entire line.  To enable this, the variable <code>idlwave-do-actions</code>
must be non-<code>nil</code>. 
<li><a name="index-Foreign-code_002c-adapting-184"></a><a name="index-Actions_002c-applied-to-foreign-code-185"></a>Actions can also be applied to a larger piece of code, e.g., to convert
foreign code to your own style.  To do this, mark the relevant part of
the code and execute <kbd>M-x expand-region-abbrevs</kbd>.  Useful marking
commands are <kbd>C-x h</kbd> (the entire file) or <kbd>C-M-h</kbd> (the current
subprogram). See <a href="Code-Indentation.html#Code-Indentation">Code Indentation</a>, for information how to adjust the
indentation of the code. 
</ul>

<div class="defun">

<blockquote><p>Non-<code>nil</code> means performs actions when indenting.  Individual action
settings are described below and set separately.
