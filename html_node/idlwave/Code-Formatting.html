   <p>The IDL language, with its early roots in FORTRAN, modern
implementation in C, and liberal borrowing of features of many vector
and other languages along its 25+ year history, has inherited an
unusual mix of syntax elements.  Left to his or her own devices, a
novice IDL programmer will often conjure code which is very difficult
to read and impossible to adapt.  Much can be gleaned from studying
available IDL code libraries for coding style pointers, but, due to
the variety of IDL syntax elements, replicating this style can be
challenging at best.  Luckily, IDLWAVE understands the structure of
IDL code very well, and takes care of almost all formatting issues for
you.  After configuring it to match your coding standards, you can
rely on it to help keep your code neat and organized.
