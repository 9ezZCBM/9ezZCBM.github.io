<h3 class="appendixsec">A.3 Catalogs</h3>

<p><a name="index-Catalogs-358"></a>
<em>Catalogs</em> are files containing scanned information on individual
routines, including arguments and keywords, calling sequence, file path,
class and procedure vs. function type, etc.  They represent a way of
extending the internal built-in information available for IDL system
routines (see <a href="Routine-Info.html#Routine-Info">Routine Info</a>) to other source collections.

   <p>Starting with version 5.0, there are two types of catalogs available
with IDLWAVE.  The traditional <em>user catalog</em> and the newer
<em>library catalogs</em>.  Although they can be used interchangeably, the
library catalogs are more flexible, and preferred.  There are few
occasions when a user catalog might be preferred&mdash;read below.  Both
types of catalogs can coexist without causing problems.

   <p>To facilitate the catalog systems, IDLWAVE stores information it gathers
from the shell about the IDL search paths, and can write this
information out automatically, or on-demand (menu <code>Debug-&gt;Save Path
Info</code>).  On systems with no shell from which to discover the path
information (e.g., Windows), a library path must be specified in
<code>idlwave-library-path</code> to allow library catalogs to be located, and
to setup directories for user catalog scan (see <a href="User-Catalog.html#User-Catalog">User Catalog</a> for
more on this variable).  Note that, before the shell is running, IDLWAVE
can only know about the IDL search path by consulting the file pointed
to by <code>idlwave-path-file</code> (<samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/idlwave/idlpath.el</span></samp>, by
default).  If <code>idlwave-auto-write-path</code> is enabled (which is the
default), the paths are written out whenever the IDLWAVE shell is
started.
