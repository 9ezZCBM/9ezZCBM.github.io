<h4 class="subsection">4.4.2 Object Method Completion and Class Ambiguity</h4>

<p><a name="index-Object-methods-148"></a><a name="index-Class-ambiguity-149"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bself_007d-object_002c-default-class-150"></a>An object method is not uniquely determined without the object's class. 
Since the class is almost always omitted in the calling source (as
required to obtain the true benefits of object-based programming),
IDLWAVE considers all available methods in all classes as possible
method name completions.  The combined list of keywords of the current
method in <em>all</em> known classes which contain that method will be
considered for keyword completion.  In the <samp><span class="file">*Completions*</span></samp> buffer,
the matching classes will be shown next to each item (see option
<code>idlwave-completion-show-classes</code>).  As a special case, the class
of an object called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">self</span></samp>&rsquo; is always taken to be the class of the
current routine, when in an IDLWAVE buffer.  All inherits classes are
considered as well.

   <p><a name="index-Forcing-class-query_002e-151"></a><a name="index-Class-query_002c-forcing-152"></a>You can also call <code>idlwave-complete</code> with a prefix arg: <kbd>C-u
M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>.  IDLWAVE will then prompt you for the class in order to
narrow down the number of possible completions.  The variable
<code>idlwave-query-class</code> can be configured to make such prompting the
default for all methods (not recommended), or selectively for very
common methods for which the number of completing keywords would be too
large (e.g., <code>Init,SetProperty,GetProperty</code>).

   <p><a name="index-Saving-object-class-on-_0040code_007b_002d_003e_007d-153"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002d_003e_007d-154"></a>After you have specified the class for a particular statement (e.g., when
completing the method), IDLWAVE can remember it for the rest of the
editing session.  Subsequent completions in the same statement
(e.g., keywords) can then reuse this class information.  This works by
placing a text property on the method invocation operator &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;,
after which the operator will be shown in a different face (bold by
default).  The variable <code>idlwave-store-inquired-class</code> can be used
to turn it off or on.
