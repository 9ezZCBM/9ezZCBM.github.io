<h4 class="subsection">4.4.1 Case of Completed Words</h4>

<p><a name="index-Case-of-completed-words-143"></a><a name="index-Mixed-case-completion-144"></a>IDL is a case-insensitive language, so casing is a matter of style
only.  IDLWAVE helps maintain a consistent casing style for completed
items.  The case of the completed words is determined by what is
already in the buffer.  As an exception, when the partial word being
completed is all lower case, the completion will be lower case as
well.  If at least one character is upper case, the string will be
completed in upper case or mixed case, depending on the value of the
variable <code>idlwave-completion-case</code>.  The default is to use upper
case for procedures, functions and keywords, and mixed case for object
class names and methods, similar to the conventions in the IDL
manuals.  For instance, to enable mixed-case completion for routines
in addition to classes and methods, you need an entry such as
<code>(routine . preserve)</code> in that variable.  To enable total control
over the case of completed items, independent of buffer context, set
<code>idlwave-completion-force-default-case</code> to non-<code>nil</code>.
