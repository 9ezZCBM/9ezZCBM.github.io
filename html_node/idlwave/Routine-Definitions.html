Routines which can be used in an IDL program can be defined in
several places:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li><em>Builtin routines</em> are defined inside IDL itself.  The source code
of such routines is not available, but instead are learned about through
the IDL documentation. 
<li>Routines which are <em>part of the current program</em>, are defined in a
file explicitly compiled by the user.  This file may or may not be
located on the IDL search path. 
<li><em>Library routines</em> are defined in files located on IDL's search
path.  When a library routine is called for the first time, IDL will
find the source file and compile it dynamically.  A special sub-category
of library routines are the <em>system routines</em> distributed with IDL,
and usually available in the <samp><span class="file">lib</span></samp> subdirectory of the IDL
distribution. 
<li>External routines written in other languages (like Fortran or C) can be
called with <code>CALL_EXTERNAL</code>, linked into IDL via <code>LINKIMAGE</code>,
or included as dynamically loaded modules (DLMs).  Currently IDLWAVE
cannot provide routine info and completion for such external routines,
except by querying the Shell for calling information (DLMs only).
