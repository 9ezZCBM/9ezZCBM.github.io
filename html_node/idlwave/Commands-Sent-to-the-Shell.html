<h3 class="section">5.3 Commands Sent to the Shell</h3>

<p><a name="index-Commands-in-shell_002c-showing-279"></a><a name="index-Showing-commands-in-shell-280"></a>
The IDLWAVE buffers and shell interact very closely.  In addition to the
normal commands you enter at the <code>IDL&gt;</code> prompt, many other special
commands are sent to the shell, sometimes as a direct result of invoking
a key command, menu item, or toolbar button, but also automatically, as
part of the normal flow of information updates between the buffer and
shell.

   <p>The commands sent include <code>breakpoint</code>, <code>.step</code> and other
debug commands (see <a href="Debugging-IDL-Programs.html#Debugging-IDL-Programs">Debugging IDL Programs</a>), <code>.run</code> and other
compilation statements (see <a href="Compiling-Programs.html#Compiling-Programs">Compiling Programs</a>), examination
commands like <code>print</code> and <code>help</code> (see <a href="Examining-Variables.html#Examining-Variables">Examining Variables</a>), and other special purpose commands designed to keep
information on the running shell current.

   <p>By default, much of this background shell input and output is hidden
from the user, but this is configurable.  The custom variable
<code>idlwave-abbrev-show-commands</code> allows you to configure which
commands sent to the shell are shown there.  For a related customization
for separating the output of <em>examine</em> commands, see <a href="Examining-Variables.html#Examining-Variables">Examining Variables</a>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>idlwave-shell-show-commands</b> (<code>'(run misc breakpoint)</code>)<var><a name="index-idlwave_002dshell_002dshow_002dcommands-281"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A list of command types to echo in the shell when sent.  Possible values
are <code>run</code> for <code>.run</code>, <code>.compile</code> and other run commands,
<code>misc</code> for lesser used commands like <code>window</code>,
<code>retall</code>,<code>close</code>, etc., <code>breakpoint</code> for breakpoint
setting and clearing commands, and <code>debug</code> for other debug,
stepping, and continue commands.  In addition, if the variable is set to
the single symbol <code>'everything</code>, all the copious shell input is
displayed (which is probably only useful for debugging purposes). 
N.B. For hidden commands which produce output by side-effect, that
output remains hidden (e.g., stepping through a <code>print</code> command). 
As a special case, any error message in the output will be displayed
(e.g., stepping to an error).
