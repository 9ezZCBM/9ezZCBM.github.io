<h4 class="subsection">10.2.12 Statement Block Symbols</h4>

<!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->
<p>There are a few occasions where a statement block might be used inside
an expression.  One is in C or C++ code using the gcc extension for
this, e.g.:

<pre class="example">      1: int res = ({
      2:         int y = foo (); int z;
      3:         if (y &gt; 0) z = y; else z = - y;
      4:         z;
      5:     });
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-inexpr_002dstatement-503"></a>Lines 2 and 5 get the <code>inexpr-statement</code> syntax, besides the
symbols they'd get in a normal block.  Therefore, the indentation put on
<code>inexpr-statement</code> is added to the normal statement block
indentation.  An <code>inexpr-statement</code> syntactic element doesn't
contain an anchor position.

   <p>C++11's lambda expressions involve a block inside a statement.  For
example:

<pre class="example">      1:  std::for_each(someList.begin(), someList.end(), [&amp;total](int x) {
      2:                                                     total += x;
      3:                                                 });
</pre>
   <p>Here a lambda expressions begins at the open bracket on line 1 and
ends at the closing brace on line 3.  Line 2, in addition to the
familiar <code>defun-block-intro</code> syntactic element, is also prefixed
by an <code>inlambda</code> element, which is typically used to indent the
entire lambda expression to under the opening bracket.

   <p>In Pike code, there are a few other situations where blocks occur inside
statements, as illustrated here:

<pre class="example">      1: array itgob()
      2: {
      3:     string s = map (backtrace()[-2][3..],
      4:                     lambda
      5:                         (mixed arg)
      6:                     {
      7:                         return sprintf ("%t", arg);
      8:                     }) * ", " + "\n";
      9:     return catch {
     10:             write (s + "\n");
     11:         };
     12: }
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-inlambda-504"></a><a name="index-lambda_002dintro_002dcont-505"></a>Lines 4 through 8 contain a lambda function, which CC Mode recognizes
by the <code>lambda</code> keyword.  If the function argument list is put
on a line of its own, as in line 5, it gets the <code>lambda-intro-cont</code>
syntax.  The function body is handled as an inline method body, with the
addition of the <code>inlambda</code> syntactic symbol.  This means that line
6 gets <code>inlambda</code> and <code>inline-open</code>, and line 8 gets
<code>inline-close</code><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

   <p><a name="index-inexpr_002dstatement-506"></a>On line 9, <code>catch</code> is a special function taking a statement block
as its argument.  The block is handled as an in-expression statement
with the <code>inexpr-statement</code> syntax, just like the gcc extended C
example above.  The other similar special function, <code>gauge</code>, is
handled like this too.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> You might wonder why it doesn't get
<code>inlambda</code> too.  It's because the closing brace is relative to the
opening brace, which stands on its own line in this example.  If the
opening brace was hanging on the previous line, then the closing brace
would get the <code>inlambda</code> syntax too to be indented correctly.</p>
