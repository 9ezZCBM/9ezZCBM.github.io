<h3 class="section">10.3 Indentation Calculation</h3>

<p><a name="index-indentation-509"></a><!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->

   <p>Indentation for a line is calculated from the syntactic context
(see <a href="Syntactic-Analysis.html#Syntactic-Analysis">Syntactic Analysis</a>).

   <p>First, a buffer position is found whose column will be the base for the
indentation calculation.  It's the anchor position in the first
syntactic element that provides one that is used.  If no syntactic
element has an anchor position then column zero is used.

   <p>Second, the syntactic symbols in each syntactic element are looked up
in the <code>c-offsets-alist</code> style variable
(see <a href="c_002doffsets_002dalist.html#c_002doffsets_002dalist">c-offsets-alist</a>), which is an association list of syntactic
symbols and the offsets to apply for those symbols.  These offsets are
added together with the base column to produce the new indentation
column.

   <p>Let's use our two code examples above to see how this works.  Here is
our first example again:

<pre class="example">      1: void swap( int&amp; a, int&amp; b )
      2: {
      3:     int tmp = a;
      4:     a = b;
      5:     b = tmp;
      6: }
</pre>
   <p>Let's say point is on line 3 and we hit the &lt;TAB&gt; key to reindent
the line.  The syntactic context for that line is:

<pre class="example">     ((defun-block-intro 29))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Since buffer position 29 is the first and only anchor position in the
list, CC Mode goes there and asks for the current column.  This brace
is in column zero, so CC Mode uses &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>&rsquo; as the base column.

   <p>Next, CC Mode looks up <code>defun-block-intro</code> in the
<code>c-offsets-alist</code> style variable.  Let's say it finds the value
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">4</span></samp>&rsquo;; it adds this to the base column &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>&rsquo;, yielding a running
total indentation of 4 spaces.

   <p>Since there is only one syntactic element on the list for this line,
indentation calculation is complete, and the total indentation for the
line is 4 spaces.

   <p>Here's another example:

<pre class="example">      1: int add( int val, int incr, int doit )
      2: {
      3:     if( doit )
      4:         {
      5:             return( val + incr );
      6:         }
      7:     return( val );
      8: }
</pre>
   <p>If we were to hit <kbd>TAB</kbd> on line 4 in the above example, the same
basic process is performed, despite the differences in the syntactic
context.  The context for this line is:

<pre class="example">     ((substatement-open 46))
</pre>
   <p>Here, CC Mode goes to buffer position 46, which is the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo; in
<code>if</code> on line 3.  This character is in the fourth column on that
line so the base column is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">4</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Then CC Mode looks up the
<code>substatement-open</code> symbol in <code>c-offsets-alist</code>.  Let's say it
finds the value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">4</span></samp>&rsquo;.  It's added with the base column and yields an
indentation for the line of 8 spaces.

   <p>Simple, huh?

   <p>Actually, it's a bit more complicated than that since the entries on
<code>c-offsets-alist</code> can be much more than plain offsets. 
See <a href="c_002doffsets_002dalist.html#c_002doffsets_002dalist">c-offsets-alist</a>, for the full story.

   <p>Anyway, the mode usually just does The Right Thing without you having to
think about it in this much detail.  But when customizing indentation,
it's helpful to understand the general indentation model being used.

   <p>As you configure CC Mode, you might want to set the variable
<code>c-echo-syntactic-information-p</code> to non-<code>nil</code> so that the
syntactic context and calculated offset always is echoed in the
minibuffer when you hit <kbd>TAB</kbd>.
