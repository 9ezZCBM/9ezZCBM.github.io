<p><a name="index-styles-290"></a><!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->

   <p>By <dfn>style</dfn> we mean the layout of the code&mdash;things like how many
columns to indent a block of code, whether an opening brace gets
indented to the level of the code it encloses, or of the construct
that introduces it, or &ldquo;hangs&rdquo; at the end of a line.

   <p>Most people only need to edit code formatted in just a few well-defined
and consistent styles.  For example, their organization might impose a
&ldquo;blessed&rdquo; style that all its programmers must conform to.  Similarly,
people who work on GNU software will have to use the GNU coding style. 
Some shops are more lenient, allowing a variety of coding styles, and as
programmers come and go, there could be a number of styles in use.  For
this reason, CC Mode makes it convenient for you to set up logical
groupings of customizations called <dfn>styles</dfn>, associate a single name
for any particular style, and pretty easily start editing new or
existing code using these styles.

   <p>As an alternative to writing a style definition yourself, you can have
CC Mode <dfn>guess</dfn> (at least part of) your style by looking at an
already formatted piece of your code, <a href="Guessing-the-Style.html#Guessing-the-Style">Guessing the Style</a>.
