<h3 class="section">4.7 Auto-newline Insertion</h3>

<p><a name="index-auto_002dnewline-159"></a><!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->

   <p>When you have <dfn>Auto-newline minor mode</dfn> enabled (see <a href="Minor-Modes.html#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>), CC Mode inserts newlines for you automatically (in certain
syntactic contexts) when you type a left or right brace, a colon, a
semicolon, or a comma.  Sometimes a newline appears before the
character you type, sometimes after it, sometimes both.

   <p>Auto-newline only triggers when the following conditions hold:

     <ul>
<li>Auto-newline minor mode is enabled, as evidenced by the indicator
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; after the mode name on the modeline (e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C/a</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C/la</span></samp>&rsquo;).

     <li>The character was typed at the end of a line, or with only whitespace
after it, and possibly a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; escaping the newline.

     <li>The character is not on its own line already.  (This applies only to
insertion of a newline <em>before</em> the character.)

     <li><a name="index-literal-160"></a><a name="index-syntactic-whitespace-161"></a>The character was not typed inside of a literal <a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

     <li>No numeric argument was supplied to the command (i.e., it was typed as
normal, with no <kbd>C-u</kbd> prefix). 
</ul>

   <p>You can configure the precise circumstances in which newlines get
inserted (see see <a href="Custom-Auto_002dnewlines.html#Custom-Auto_002dnewlines">Custom Auto-newlines</a>).  Typically, the style
system (see <a href="Styles.html#Styles">Styles</a>) will have set this up for you, so you probably
won't have to bother.

   <p>Sometimes CC Mode inserts an auto-newline where you don't want one,
such as after a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">}</span></samp>&rsquo; when you're about to type a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Hungry deletion can help here (see <a href="Hungry-WS-Deletion.html#Hungry-WS-Deletion">Hungry WS Deletion</a>), or you can
activate an appropriate <dfn>clean-up</dfn>, which will remove the excess
whitespace after you've typed the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo;.  See <a href="Clean_002dups.html#Clean_002dups">Clean-ups</a> for a
full description.  See also <a href="Electric-Keys.html#Electric-Keys">Electric Keys</a> for a summary of
clean-ups listed by key.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> A
<dfn>literal</dfn> is defined as any comment, string, or preprocessor macro
definition.  These constructs are also known as <dfn>syntactic
whitespace</dfn> since they are usually ignored when scanning C code.</p>
