<h3 class="section">5.5 AWK Mode Font Locking</h3>

<!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->
<p>The general appearance of font-locking in AWK mode is much like in any
other programming mode.  See <a href="../elisp/Faces-for-Font-Lock.html#Faces-for-Font-Lock">Faces for Font Lock</a>.

   <p>The following faces are, however, used in a non-standard fashion in
AWK mode:

     <dl>
<dt><code>font-lock-variable-name-face</code><dd>This face was intended for variable declarations.  Since variables are
not declared in AWK, this face is used instead for AWK system
variables (such as <code>NF</code>) and &ldquo;Special File Names&rdquo; (such as
<code>"/dev/stderr"</code>).

     <br><dt><code>font-lock-builtin-face</code> (Emacs)/<code>font-lock-preprocessor-face</code> (XEmacs)<dd>This face is normally used for preprocessor directives in CC Mode. 
There are no such things in AWK, so this face is used instead for
standard functions (such as <code>match</code>).

     <br><dt><code>font-lock-string-face</code><dd>As well as being used for strings, including localizable strings,
(delimited by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_"</span></samp>&rsquo;), this face is also used for AWK
regular expressions (delimited by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;).

     <br><dt><code>font-lock-warning-face</code> (Emacs)/<code>c-invalid-face</code> (XEmacs)<dd>This face highlights the following syntactically invalid AWK
constructs:

          <ul>
<li>An unterminated string or regular expression.  Here the opening
delimiter (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_"</span></samp>&rsquo;) is displayed in
<code>font-lock-warning-face</code>.  This is most noticeable when typing in a
new string/regular expression into a buffer, when the warning-face
serves as a continual reminder to terminate the construct.

          <p>AWK mode fontifies unterminated strings/regular expressions
differently from other modes: Only the text up to the end of the line
is fontified as a string (escaped newlines being handled correctly),
rather than the text up to the next string quote.

          <li>A space between the function name and opening parenthesis when calling
a user function.  The last character of the function name and the
opening parenthesis are highlighted.  This font-locking rule will
spuriously highlight a valid concatenation expression where an
identifier precedes a parenthesized expression.  Unfortunately.

          <li>Whitespace following the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; in what otherwise looks like an
escaped newline.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; is highlighted. 
</ul>
     </dl>
