<h4 class="subsection">10.2.5 Brace List Symbols</h4>

<!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->
<p><a name="index-brace-lists-461"></a>There are a set of syntactic symbols that are used to recognize
constructs inside of brace lists.  A brace list is defined as an
<code>enum</code> or aggregate initializer list, such as might statically
initialize an array of structs.  The three special aggregate constructs
in Pike, <code>({ })</code>, <code>([ ])</code> and <code>(&lt; &gt;)</code>, are treated as
brace lists too.  An example:

<pre class="example">      1: static char* ingredients[] =
      2: {
      3:     "Ham",
      4:     "Salt",
      5:     NULL
      6: };
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-brace_002dlist_002dopen-462"></a><a name="index-brace_002dlist_002dintro-463"></a><a name="index-brace_002dlist_002dclose-464"></a><a name="index-brace_002dlist_002dentry-465"></a>Following convention, line 2 in this example is assigned
<code>brace-list-open</code> syntax, and line 3 is assigned
<code>brace-list-intro</code> syntax.  Likewise, line 6 is assigned
<code>brace-list-close</code> syntax.  Lines 4 and 5 however, are assigned
<code>brace-list-entry</code> syntax, as would all subsequent lines in this
initializer list.

   <p><a name="index-brace_002dentry_002dopen-466"></a>Your static initializer might be initializing nested structures, for
example:

<pre class="example">      1: struct intpairs[] =
      2: {
      3:     { 1, 2 },
      4:     {
      5:         3,
      6:         4
      7:     }
      8:     { 1,
      9:       2 },
     10:     { 3, 4 }
     11: };
</pre>
   <p>Here, you've already seen the analysis of lines 1, 2, 3, and 11.  On
line 4, things get interesting; this line is assigned
<code>brace-entry-open</code> syntactic symbol because it's a bracelist
entry line that starts with an open brace.  Lines 5 and 6 are pretty
standard, and line 7 is a <code>brace-list-close</code> as you'd expect. 
Once again, line 8 is assigned as <code>brace-entry-open</code> as is line
10.  Line 9 is assigned two syntactic elements, <code>brace-list-intro</code>
with anchor point at the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{</span></samp>&rsquo; of line 8<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, and
<code>brace-list-entry</code> anchored on the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo; of line 8.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> This extra
syntactic element was introduced in CC Mode 5.33.1 to allow extra
flexibility in indenting the second line of such a construct.  You can
preserve the behavior resulting from the former syntactic analysis by
giving <code>brace-list-entry</code> an offset of
<code>c-lineup-under-anchor</code> (see <a href="Misc-Line_002dUp.html#Misc-Line_002dUp">Misc Line-Up</a>).</p>
