<!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->
<p>In some languages, particularly in C++, there are constructs which are
syntactically ambiguous&mdash;they could be either declarations or
expressions, and CC Mode cannot tell for sure which.  Often such a
construct is one of the operators &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo; surrounded by
two identifiers.

   <p>Experience shows that very often when such a construct is a
declaration it will be written with the operator touching exactly one
of the identifiers, like:

<pre class="example">     foo *bar
</pre>
   <p>or
<pre class="example">     foo&amp; bar
</pre>
   <p>.  Whether such code is fontified depends on the setting of
<code>c-asymmetry-fontification-flag</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>c-asymmetry-fontification-flag</b><var><a name="index-c_002dasymmetry_002dfontification_002dflag-270"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-asymmetry_002dfontification_002dflag-_0040r_007b_0028c_002d_0029_007d-271"></a>When <code>c-asymmetry-fontification-flag</code> is non-nil (which it is by
default), code like the above, with white space either before or after
the operator, but not both, is fontified as a declaration.  When the
variable is nil, such a construct gets the default face. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>When the construct is an expression there will often be white space
both before and after the operator or there will be no white space
around it at all, like:

<pre class="example">     foo * bar
</pre>
   <p>or
<pre class="example">     foo&amp;bar
</pre>
   <p>.

   <p>Such code is not fontified as a declaration.  (Typically, the
identifiers don't get a non-default face.)

   <p>For clarity's sake, we emphasize that the &ldquo;asymmetry&rdquo; rule in this
section only applies when CC Mode cannot disambiguate a construct in
any other way.
