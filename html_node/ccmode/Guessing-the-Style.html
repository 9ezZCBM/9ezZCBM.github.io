<h4 class="subsection">6.3.4 Guessing the Style</h4>

<!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->
<p>Instead of specifying a style, you can get CC Mode to <dfn>guess</dfn>
your style by examining an already formatted code buffer.  CC Mode
then determines the &rdquo;most frequent&rdquo; offset (see <a href="c_002doffsets_002dalist.html#c_002doffsets_002dalist">c-offsets-alist</a>)
for each of the syntactic symbols (see <a href="Indentation-Engine-Basics.html#Indentation-Engine-Basics">Indentation Engine Basics</a>)
encountered in the buffer, and the &rdquo;most frequent&rdquo; value of
c-basic-offset (see <a href="Customizing-Indentation.html#Customizing-Indentation">Customizing Indentation</a>), then merges the
current style with these &rdquo;guesses&rdquo; to form a new style.  This
combined style is known as the <dfn>guessed style</dfn>.

   <p>To do this, call <code>c-guess</code> (or one of the other 5 guessing
commands) on your sample buffer.  The analysis of your code may take
some time.

   <p>You can then set the guessed style in any CC Mode buffer with
<code>c-guess-install</code>.  You can display the style with
<code>c-guess-view</code>, and preserve it by copying it into your
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> for future use, preferably after editing it.

style from it.

     <p>The part of the buffer examined is either the region
(<code>c-guess-region-no-install</code>), the entire buffer
(<code>c-guess-buffer-no-install</code>), or the first
<code>c-guess-region-max</code> bytes (<code>c-guess-no-install</code>).

     <p>Each of these commands can be given an optional prefix argument.  This
instructs CC Mode to combine the new guesses with the current
guesses before forming the guessed style.

from it, then install the guessed style on the buffer.  The guessed
style is given a name based on the buffer's absolute file name, and
you can then set this style on any CC Mode buffer with <kbd>C-c .</kbd>.

     <p>The part of the buffer examined is either the region
(<code>c-guess-region</code>), the entire buffer (<code>c-guess-buffer</code>), or
the first <code>c-guess-region-max</code> bytes (<code>c-guess</code>).

portion examined by c-guess and c-guess-no-install.  If set to

inwards, which will be taken into account by the analysis process.

variable to a large number.

Set the current buffer's style to the guessed style.  This prompts you
to enter an optional new style name to give to the guessed style.  By
default, this name is based on the buffer's absolute file name.  You
can then use this style like any other.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x c-guess-view</kbd><dd><a name="index-c_002dguess_002dview-330"></a><a name="index-guess_002dview-_0040r_007b_0028c_002d_0029_007d-331"></a>Display the most recently guessed style in a temporary buffer.  This
display is in the form of a <code>c-add-style</code> form (see <a href="Adding-Styles.html#Adding-Styles">Adding Styles</a>) which can be easily copied to your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>.  You will
probably want to edit it first.

     <p>The display of the guessed style contains these elements:

          <dl>
<dt>Placeholder Name<dd>You should replace this with a style name of your own. 
<br><dt>Parent Style<dd>The style current when the guessing began, from which the guessed
style inherits (see <a href="Config-Basics.html#Config-Basics">Config Basics</a>) the settings which weren't
guessed. 
<br><dt>Guessed Offsets<dd>These are the core result of the guessing process.  Each of them is
marked by a comment. 
<br><dt>Inherited Offsets<dd>These are syntactic offsets which have been taken over from the parent
style.  To avoid possible future conflicts, you should remove either
these offsets or the parent style name.
