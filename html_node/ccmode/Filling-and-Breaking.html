<h3 class="section">4.4 Filling and Line Breaking Commands</h3>

<p><a name="index-text-filling-87"></a><a name="index-line-breaking-88"></a><a name="index-comment-handling-89"></a><!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->

   <p>Since there's a lot of normal text in comments and string literals,
CC Mode provides features to edit these like in text mode.  The goal
is to do it seamlessly, i.e., you can use auto fill mode, sentence and
paragraph movement, paragraph filling, adaptive filling etc. wherever
there's a piece of normal text without having to think much about it. 
CC Mode keeps the indentation, fixes suitable comment line prefixes,
and so on.

   <p>You can configure the exact way comments get filled and broken, and
where Emacs does auto-filling (see see <a href="Custom-Filling-and-Breaking.html#Custom-Filling-and-Breaking">Custom Filling and Breaking</a>).  Typically, the style system (see <a href="Styles.html#Styles">Styles</a>) will have
set this up for you, so you probably won't have to bother.

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dfill_002dmode-90"></a><a name="index-Auto-Fill-mode-91"></a><a name="index-paragraph-filling-92"></a>Line breaks are by default handled (almost) the same regardless of
whether they are made by auto fill mode (see <a href="../emacs/Auto-Fill.html#Auto-Fill">Auto Fill</a>), by paragraph filling (e.g., with
<kbd>M-q</kbd>), or explicitly with <kbd>M-j</kbd> or similar methods.  In
string literals, the new line gets the same indentation as the
previous nonempty line.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-q</kbd> (<code>c-fill-paragraph</code>)<dd><a name="index-M_002dq-93"></a><a name="index-c_002dfill_002dparagraph-94"></a><a name="index-fill_002dparagraph-_0040r_007b_0028c_002d_0029_007d-95"></a><a name="index-Javadoc-markup-96"></a><a name="index-Pike-autodoc-markup-97"></a>This command fills multiline string literals and both block
and line style comments.  In Java buffers, the Javadoc markup words
are recognized as paragraph starters.  The line oriented Pike autodoc
markup words are recognized in the same way in Pike mode.

     <p>The formatting of the starters (<code>/*</code>) and enders (<code>*/</code>) of
block comments are kept as they were before the filling.  I.e., if
either the starter or ender were on a line of its own, then it stays
on its own line; conversely, if the delimiter has comment text on its
line, it keeps at least one word of that text with it on the line.

     <p>This command is the replacement for <code>fill-paragraph</code> in CC Mode
buffers.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-j</kbd> (<code>c-indent-new-comment-line</code>)<dd><a name="index-M_002dj-98"></a><a name="index-c_002dindent_002dnew_002dcomment_002dline-99"></a><a name="index-indent_002dnew_002dcomment_002dline-_0040r_007b_0028c_002d_0029_007d-100"></a>This breaks the current line at point and indents the new line.  If
point was in a comment, the new line gets the proper comment line
prefix.  If point was inside a macro, a backslash is inserted before
the line break.  It is the replacement for
<code>indent-new-comment-line</code>.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x c-context-line-break</kbd><dd><a name="index-c_002dcontext_002dline_002dbreak-101"></a><a name="index-context_002dline_002dbreak-_0040r_007b_0028c_002d_0029_007d-102"></a>Insert a line break suitable to the context: If the point is inside a
comment, the new line gets the suitable indentation and comment line
prefix like <code>c-indent-new-comment-line</code>.  In normal code it's
indented like <code>newline-and-indent</code> would do.  In macros it acts
like <code>newline-and-indent</code> but additionally inserts and optionally
aligns the line ending backslash so that the macro remains unbroken. 
See <a href="Custom-Macros.html#Custom-Macros">Custom Macros</a>, for details about the backslash alignment.  In a
string, a backslash is inserted only if the string is within a
macro<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>.

     <p>This function is not bound to a key by default, but it's intended to be
used on the <kbd>RET</kbd> key.  If you like the behavior of
<code>newline-and-indent</code> on <kbd>RET</kbd>, you should consider switching to
this function.  See <a href="Sample-Init-File.html#Sample-Init-File">Sample Init File</a>.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x c-context-open-line</kbd><dd><a name="index-c_002dcontext_002dopen_002dline-103"></a><a name="index-context_002dopen_002dline-_0040r_007b_0028c_002d_0029_007d-104"></a>This is to <kbd>C-o</kbd> (<kbd>M-x open-line</kbd>) as
<code>c-context-line-break</code> is to <kbd>RET</kbd>.  I.e., it works just like
<code>c-context-line-break</code> but leaves the point before the inserted
line break.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> You can change this default by
setting the <code>string</code> syntactic symbol (see <a href="Syntactic-Symbols.html#Syntactic-Symbols">Syntactic Symbols</a>
and see <a href="Customizing-Indentation.html#Customizing-Indentation">Customizing Indentation</a>)</p>

valid.</p>
