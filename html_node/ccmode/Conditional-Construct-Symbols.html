<h4 class="subsection">10.2.3 Conditional Construct Symbols</h4>

<!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->
<p>Here is a (totally contrived) example which illustrates how syntax is
assigned to various conditional constructs:

<pre class="example">      1: void spam( int index )
      2: {
      3:     for( int i=0; i&lt;index; i++ )
      4:     {
      5:         if( i == 10 )
      6:             do_something_special();
      7:         else
      8:           silly_label:
      9:             do_something( i );
     10:     }
     11:     do {
     12:         another_thing( i-- );
     13:     }
     14:     while( i &gt; 0 );
     15: }
</pre>
   <p>Only the lines that illustrate new syntactic symbols will be discussed.

   <p><a name="index-substatement_002dopen-450"></a><a name="index-statement_002dblock_002dintro-451"></a><a name="index-block_002dclose-452"></a>Line 4 has a brace which opens a conditional's substatement block.  It
is thus assigned <code>substatement-open</code> syntax, and since line 5 is
the first line in the substatement block, it is assigned
<code>statement-block-intro</code> syntax.  Line 10 contains the brace
that closes the inner substatement block, and is therefore given the
syntax <code>block-close</code><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  Line 13 is treated the same way.

   <p><a name="index-substatement-453"></a>Lines 6 and 9 are also substatements of conditionals, but since they
don't start blocks they are given <code>substatement</code> syntax
instead of <code>substatement-open</code>.

   <p><a name="index-substatement_002dlabel-454"></a>Line 8 contains a label, which is normally given <code>label</code> syntax. 
This one is however a bit special since it's between a conditional and
its substatement.  It's analyzed as <code>substatement-label</code> to let you
handle this rather odd case differently from normal labels.

   <p><a name="index-else_002dclause-455"></a><a name="index-catch_002dclause-456"></a>Line 7 start with an <code>else</code> that matches the <code>if</code> statement on
line 5.  It is therefore given the <code>else-clause</code> syntax and is
anchored on the matching <code>if</code>.  The <code>try</code>-<code>catch</code>
constructs in C++ and Java are treated this way too, except that
<code>catch</code> and (in Java) <code>finally</code>, are marked with
<code>catch-clause</code>.

   <p><a name="index-do_002dwhile_002dclosure-457"></a>The <code>while</code> construct on line 14 that closes a <code>do</code>
conditional is given the special syntax <code>do-while-closure</code> if it
appears on a line by itself.  Note that if the <code>while</code> appeared on
the same line as the preceding close brace, that line would still have
<code>block-close</code> syntax.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> <code>block-open</code> is used only for
&ldquo;free-standing&rdquo; blocks, and is somewhat rare (see <a href="Literal-Symbols.html#Literal-Symbols">Literal Symbols</a> for an example.)</p>
