<h4 class="subsection">28.13.3 Action Alists for Buffer Display</h4>

<p><a name="index-buffer-display-action-alist-2807"></a><a name="index-action-alist-for-buffer-display-2808"></a>
An <dfn>action alist</dfn> is an association list mapping predefined
symbols recognized by action functions to values these functions are
supposed to interpret accordingly.  In each call,
<code>display-buffer</code> constructs a new, possibly empty action alist
and passes that entire list on to any action function it calls.

   <p>By design, action functions are free in their interpretation of
action alist entries.  In fact, some entries like
<code>allow-no-window</code> or <code>previous-window</code> have a meaning only
for one or a few action functions, and are ignored by the rest.  Other
entries, like <code>inhibit-same-window</code> or <code>window-parameters</code>,
are supposed to be respected by most action functions, including those
provided by application programs and external packages.

   <p>In the previous subsection we have described in detail how
individual action functions interpret the action alist entries they
care about.  Here we give a reference list of all known action alist
entries according to their symbols, together with their values and
action functions (see <a href="Buffer-Display-Action-Functions.html#Buffer-Display-Action-Functions">Buffer Display Action Functions</a>) that
recognize them.  Throughout this list, the terms &ldquo;buffer&rdquo; will refer
to the buffer <code>display-buffer</code> is supposed to display, and
&ldquo;value&rdquo; refers to the entry's value.

     
<a name="index-inhibit_002dsame_002dwindow_0040r_007b_002c-a-buffer-display-action-alist-entry_007d-2809"></a>
<dl><dt><code>inhibit-same-window</code><dd>If the value is non-<code>nil</code>, this signals that the selected window
must not be used for displaying the buffer.  All action functions that
(re-)use an existing window should respect this entry.

     <p><a name="index-previous_002dwindow_0040r_007b_002c-a-buffer-display-action-alist-entry_007d-2810"></a><br><dt><code>previous-window</code><dd>The value must specify a window that may have displayed the buffer
previously.  <code>display-buffer-in-previous-window</code> will give
preference to such a window provided it is still live and not
dedicated to another buffer.

     <p><a name="index-mode_0040r_007b_002c-a-buffer-display-action-alist-entry_007d-2811"></a><br><dt><code>mode</code><dd>The value is either a major mode or a list of major modes. 
<code>display-buffer-reuse-mode-window</code> may reuse a window whenever
the value specified by this entry matches the major mode of that
window's buffer.  Other action functions ignore such entries.

     <p><a name="index-frame_002dpredicate_0040r_007b_002c-a-buffer-display-action-alist-entry_007d-2812"></a><br><dt><code>frame-predicate</code><dd>The value must be a function taking one argument (a frame), supposed
to return non-<code>nil</code> if that frame is a candidate for displaying
the buffer.  This entry is used by
<code>display-buffer-use-some-frame</code>.

     <p><a name="index-reusable_002dframes_0040r_007b_002c-a-buffer-display-action-alist-entry_007d-2813"></a><br><dt><code>reusable-frames</code><dd>The value specifies the set of frames to search for a window that can
be reused because it already displays the buffer.  It can be set as
follows:

          <ul>
<li><code>nil</code> means consider only windows on the selected frame. 
(Actually, the last frame used that is not a minibuffer-only frame.) 
<li><code>t</code> means consider windows on all frames. 
<li><code>visible</code> means consider windows on all visible frames. 
<li>0 means consider windows on all visible or iconified frames. 
<li>A frame means consider windows on that frame only. 
</ul>

     <p>Note that the meaning of <code>nil</code> differs slightly from that of the
<var>all-frames</var> argument to <code>next-window</code> (see <a href="Cyclic-Window-Ordering.html#Cyclic-Window-Ordering">Cyclic Window Ordering</a>).

     <p>A major client of this is <code>display-buffer-reuse-window</code>, but all
other action functions that try to reuse a window are affected as
well.

     <p><a name="index-inhibit_002dswitch_002dframe_0040r_007b_002c-a-buffer-display-action-alist-entry_007d-2814"></a><br><dt><code>inhibit-switch-frame</code><dd>A non-<code>nil</code> value prevents another frame from being raised or
selected, if the window chosen by <code>display-buffer</code> is displayed
there.  Primarily affected by this are
<code>display-buffer-use-some-frame</code> and
<code>display-buffer-reuse-window</code>. 
<code>display-buffer-pop-up-frame</code> should be affected as well, but
there is no guarantee that the window manager will comply.

     <p><a name="index-window_002dparameters_0040r_007b_002c-a-buffer-display-action-alist-entry_007d-2815"></a><br><dt><code>window-parameters</code><dd>The value specifies an alist of window parameters to give the chosen
window.  All action functions that choose a window should process this
entry.

     <p><a name="index-window_002dheight_0040r_007b_002c-a-buffer-display-action-alist-entry_007d-2816"></a><br><dt><code>window-height</code><dd>The value specifies whether and how to adjust the height of the chosen
window and can be one of the following:

          <ul>
<li><code>nil</code> means to leave the height of the chosen window alone.

          <li>An integer number specifies the desired total height of the chosen
window in lines.

          <li>A floating-point number specifies the fraction of the chosen window's
desired total height with respect to the total height of its frame's
root window.

          <li>If the value specifies a function, that function is called with one
argument&mdash;the chosen window.  The function is supposed to adjust the
height of the window; its return value is ignored.  Suitable functions
are <code>shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer</code> and
<code>fit-window-to-buffer</code>, see <a href="Resizing-Windows.html#Resizing-Windows">Resizing Windows</a>. 
</ul>

     <p>By convention, the height of the chosen window is adjusted only if the
window is part of a vertical combination (see <a href="Windows-and-Frames.html#Windows-and-Frames">Windows and Frames</a>)
to avoid changing the height of other, unrelated windows.  Also, this
entry should be processed only under certain conditions which are
specified right below this list.

     <p><a name="index-window_002dwidth_0040r_007b_002c-a-buffer-display-action-alist-entry_007d-2817"></a><br><dt><code>window-width</code><dd>This entry is similar to the <code>window-height</code> entry described
before, but used to adjust the chosen window's width instead.  The
value can be one of the following:

          <ul>
<li><code>nil</code> means to leave the width of the chosen window alone.

          <li>An integer specifies the desired total width of the chosen window in
columns.

          <li>A floating-point number specifies the fraction of the chosen window's
desired total width with respect to the total width of the frame's
root window.

          <li>If the value specifies a function, that function is called with one
argument&mdash;the chosen window.  The function is supposed to adjust the
width of the window; its return value is ignored. 
</ul>

     <p>By convention, the width of the chosen window is adjusted only if the
window is part of a horizontal combination (see <a href="Windows-and-Frames.html#Windows-and-Frames">Windows and Frames</a>) to avoid changing the width of other, unrelated windows. 
Also, this entry should be processed under only certain conditions
which are specified right below this list.

     <p><a name="index-preserve_002dsize_0040r_007b_002c-a-buffer-display-action-alist-entry_007d-2818"></a><br><dt><code>preserve-size</code><dd>If non-<code>nil</code> such an entry tells Emacs to preserve the size of
the window chosen (see <a href="Preserving-Window-Sizes.html#Preserving-Window-Sizes">Preserving Window Sizes</a>).  The value should
be either <code>(t&nbsp;.&nbsp;nil)</code><!-- /@w --> to preserve the width of the window,
<code>(nil&nbsp;.&nbsp;t)</code><!-- /@w --> to preserve its height or <code>(t&nbsp;.&nbsp;t)</code><!-- /@w --> to
preserve both, its width and its height.  This entry should be
processed only under certain conditions which are specified right
after this list.

     <p><a name="index-pop_002dup_002dframe_002dparameters_0040r_007b_002c-a-buffer-display-action-alist-entry_007d-2819"></a><br><dt><code>pop-up-frame-parameters</code><dd>The value specifies an alist of frame parameters to give a new frame,
if one is created.  <code>display-buffer-pop-up-frame</code> is its one and
only addressee.

     <p><a name="index-parent_002dframe_0040r_007b_002c-a-buffer-display-action-alist-entry_007d-2820"></a><br><dt><code>parent-frame</code><dd>The value specifies the parent frame to be used when the buffer is
displayed on a child frame.  This entry is used only by
<code>display-buffer-in-child-frame</code>.

     <p><a name="index-child_002dframe_002dparameters_0040r_007b_002c-a-buffer-display-action-alist-entry_007d-2821"></a><br><dt><code>child-frame-parameters</code><dd>The value specifies an alist of frame parameters to use when the buffer
is displayed on a child frame.  This entry is used only by
<code>display-buffer-in-child-frame</code>.

     <p><a name="index-side_0040r_007b_002c-a-buffer-display-action-alist-entry_007d-2822"></a><br><dt><code>side</code><dd>The value denotes the side of the frame or window where a new window
displaying the buffer shall be created.  This entry is used by
<code>display-buffer-in-side-window</code> to indicate the side of the frame
where a new side window shall be placed (see <a href="Displaying-Buffers-in-Side-Windows.html#Displaying-Buffers-in-Side-Windows">Displaying Buffers in Side Windows</a>).  It is also used by
<code>display-buffer-in-atom-window</code> to indicate the side of an
existing window where the new window shall be located (see <a href="Atomic-Windows.html#Atomic-Windows">Atomic Windows</a>).

     <p><a name="index-slot_0040r_007b_002c-a-buffer-display-action-alist-entry_007d-2823"></a><br><dt><code>slot</code><dd>If non-<code>nil</code>, the value specifies the slot of the side window
supposed to display the buffer.  This entry is used only by
<code>display-buffer-in-side-window</code>.

     <p><a name="index-window_0040r_007b_002c-a-buffer-display-action-alist-entry_007d-2824"></a><br><dt><code>window</code><dd>The value specifies a window that is in some way related to the window
chosen by <code>display-buffer</code>.  This entry is currently used by
<code>display-buffer-in-atom-window</code> to indicate the window on whose
side the new window shall be created.

     <p><a name="index-allow_002dno_002dwindow_0040r_007b_002c-a-buffer-display-action-alist-entry_007d-2825"></a><br><dt><code>allow-no-window</code><dd>If the value is non-<code>nil</code>, <code>display-buffer</code> does not
necessarily have to display the buffer and the caller is prepared to
accept that.  This entry is not intended for user customizations,
since there is no guarantee that an arbitrary caller of
<code>display-buffer</code> will be able to handle the case that no window
will display the buffer.  <code>display-buffer-no-window</code> is the only
action function that cares about this entry. 
</dl>

   <p>By convention, the entries <code>window-height</code>, <code>window-width</code>
and <code>preserve-size</code> are applied after the chosen window's buffer
has been set up and if and only if that window never showed another
buffer before.  More precisely, the latter means that the window must
have been either created by the current <code>display-buffer</code> call or
the window was created earlier by <code>display-buffer</code> to show the
buffer and never was used to show another buffer until it was reused
by the current invocation of <code>display-buffer</code>.
