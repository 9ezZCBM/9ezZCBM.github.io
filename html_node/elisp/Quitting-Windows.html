<h3 class="section">28.16 Quitting Windows</h3>

<p>When you want to get rid of a window used for displaying a buffer, you
can call <code>delete-window</code> or <code>delete-windows-on</code>
(see <a href="Deleting-Windows.html#Deleting-Windows">Deleting Windows</a>) to remove that window from its frame.  If the
buffer is shown on a separate frame, you might want to call
<code>delete-frame</code> (see <a href="Deleting-Frames.html#Deleting-Frames">Deleting Frames</a>) instead.  If, on the other
hand, a window has been reused for displaying the buffer, you might
prefer showing the buffer previously shown in that window, by calling the
function <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> (see <a href="Window-History.html#Window-History">Window History</a>). 
Finally, you might want to either bury (see <a href="Buffer-List.html#Buffer-List">Buffer List</a>) or kill
(see <a href="Killing-Buffers.html#Killing-Buffers">Killing Buffers</a>) the window's buffer.

   <p>The following command uses information on how the window for
displaying the buffer was obtained in the first place, thus attempting
to automate the above decisions for you.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>quit-window</b><var> &amp;optional kill window<a name="index-quit_002dwindow-2856"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command quits <var>window</var> and buries its buffer.  The argument
<var>window</var> must be a live window and defaults to the selected one. 
With prefix argument <var>kill</var> non-<code>nil</code>, it kills the buffer
instead of burying it.  It calls the function <code>quit-restore-window</code>
described next to deal with the window and its buffer. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>quit-restore-window</b><var> &amp;optional window bury-or-kill<a name="index-quit_002drestore_002dwindow-2857"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function handles <var>window</var> and its buffer after quitting.  The
optional argument <var>window</var> must be a live window and defaults to
the selected one. The function's behavior is determined by the four
elements of the list specified by the <code>quit-restore</code> window
parameter (see <a href="Window-Parameters.html#Window-Parameters">Window Parameters</a>), which is set to <code>nil</code>
afterwards.

        <p>The first element of the <code>quit-restore</code> parameter is one of the
symbols <code>window</code>, meaning that the window has been specially
created by <code>display-buffer</code>; <code>frame</code>, a separate frame has
been created; <code>same</code>, the window has only ever displayed this
buffer; or <code>other</code>, the window showed another buffer before. 
<code>frame</code> and <code>window</code> affect how the window is quit, while
<code>same</code> and <code>other</code> affect the redisplay of buffers
previously shown in this window.

        <p>The second element is either one of the symbols <code>window</code> or
<code>frame</code>, or a list whose elements are the buffer shown in the
window before, that buffer's window start and window point positions,
and the window's height at that time.  If that buffer is still live
when the window is quit, then the function <code>quit-restore-window</code>
reuses the window to display the buffer.

        <p>The third element is the window selected at the time the parameter was
created.  If <code>quit-restore-window</code> deletes the window passed to
it as argument, it then tries to reselect this window.

        <p>The fourth element is the buffer whose display caused the creation of
this parameter.  <code>quit-restore-window</code> deletes the specified window
only if it still shows that buffer.

        <p>The window is deleted entirely if: 1) the first element of the
<code>quit-restore</code> parameter is one of 'window or 'frame, 2) the
window has no history of previously-displayed buffers, and 3) the
displayed buffer matches the one in the fourth element of the
<code>quit-restore</code> parameter.  If <var>window</var> is the
only window on its frame and there are other frames on the frame's
terminal, the value of the optional argument <var>bury-or-kill</var>
determines how to proceed with the window.  If <var>bury-or-kill</var>
equals <code>kill</code>, the frame is deleted unconditionally.  Otherwise,
the fate of the frame is determined by calling
<code>frame-auto-hide-function</code> (see below) with that frame as sole
argument.

        <p>If the third element of the <code>quit-restore</code> parameter is a list of
buffer, window start (see <a href="Window-Start-and-End.html#Window-Start-and-End">Window Start and End</a>), and point
(see <a href="Window-Point.html#Window-Point">Window Point</a>), and that buffer is still live, the buffer will
be displayed, and start and point set accordingly.  If, in addition,
<var>window</var>'s buffer was temporarily resized, this function will also
try to restore the original height of <var>window</var>.

        <p>Otherwise, if <var>window</var> was previously used for displaying other
buffers (see <a href="Window-History.html#Window-History">Window History</a>), the most recent buffer in that
history will be displayed.

        <p>The optional argument <var>bury-or-kill</var> specifies how to deal with
<var>window</var>'s buffer.  The following values are handled:

          <dl>
<dt><code>nil</code><dd>This means to not deal with the buffer in any particular way.  As a
consequence, if <var>window</var> is not deleted, invoking
<code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> will usually show the buffer again.

          <br><dt><code>append</code><dd>This means that if <var>window</var> is not deleted, its buffer is moved to
the end of <var>window</var>'s list of previous buffers, so it's less likely
that a future invocation of <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> will switch to
it.  Also, it moves the buffer to the end of the frame's buffer list.

          <br><dt><code>bury</code><dd>This means that if <var>window</var> is not deleted, its buffer is removed
from <var>window</var>'s list of previous buffers.  Also, it moves the buffer
to the end of the frame's buffer list.  This value provides the most
reliable remedy to not have <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> switch to this
buffer again without killing the buffer.

          <br><dt><code>kill</code><dd>This means to kill <var>window</var>'s buffer. 
</dl>

        <p>Typically, the display routines run by <code>display-buffer</code> will set
the <code>quit-restore</code> window parameter correctly.  It's also
possible to set it manually, using the following code for displaying
<var>buffer</var> in <var>window</var>:

     <pre class="example">          (display-buffer-record-window type window buffer)
          
          (set-window-buffer window buffer)
          
          (set-window-prev-buffers window nil)
</pre>
        <p>Setting the window history to <code>nil</code> ensures that a future call to
<code>quit-window</code> can delete the window altogether.

        </blockquote></div>

   <p>The following option specifies how to deal with a frame containing just
one window that should be either quit, or whose buffer should be buried.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>frame-auto-hide-function</b><var><a name="index-frame_002dauto_002dhide_002dfunction-2858"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The function specified by this option is called to automatically hide
frames.  This function is called with one argument&mdash;a frame.

        <p>The function specified here is called by <code>bury-buffer</code>
(see <a href="Buffer-List.html#Buffer-List">Buffer List</a>) when the selected window is dedicated and shows
the buffer to bury.  It is also called by <code>quit-restore-window</code>
(see above) when the frame of the window to quit has been specially
created for displaying that window's buffer and the buffer is not
killed.

        <p>The default is to call <code>iconify-frame</code> (see <a href="Visibility-of-Frames.html#Visibility-of-Frames">Visibility of Frames</a>).  Alternatively, you may specify either <code>delete-frame</code>
(see <a href="Deleting-Frames.html#Deleting-Frames">Deleting Frames</a>) to remove the frame from its display,
<code>make-frame-invisible</code> to make the frame invisible, <code>ignore</code>
to leave the frame unchanged, or any other function that can take a
frame as its sole argument.

        <p>Note that the function specified by this option is called only if the
specified frame contains just one live window and there is at least one
other frame on the same terminal.

        <p>For a particular frame, the value specified here may be overridden by
that frame's <code>auto-hide-function</code> frame parameter (see <a href="Frame-Interaction-Parameters.html#Frame-Interaction-Parameters">Frame Interaction Parameters</a>). 
</p></blockquote></div>
