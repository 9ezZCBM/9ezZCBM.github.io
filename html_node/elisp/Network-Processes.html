<h4 class="subsection">38.17.1 <code>make-network-process</code></h4>

<p>The basic function for creating network connections and network
servers is <code>make-network-process</code>.  It can do either of those
jobs, depending on the arguments you give it.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>make-network-process</b><var> &amp;rest args<a name="index-make_002dnetwork_002dprocess-4473"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function creates a network connection or server and returns the
process object that represents it.  The arguments <var>args</var> are a
list of keyword/argument pairs.  Omitting a keyword is always
equivalent to specifying it with value <code>nil</code>, except for
<code>:coding</code>, <code>:filter-multibyte</code>, and <code>:reuseaddr</code>.  Here
are the meaningful keywords (those corresponding to network options
are listed in the following section):

          <dl>
<dt>:name <var>name</var><dd>Use the string <var>name</var> as the process name.  It is modified if
necessary to make it unique.

          <br><dt>:type <var>type</var><dd>Specify the communication type.  A value of <code>nil</code> specifies a
stream connection (the default); <code>datagram</code> specifies a datagram
connection; <code>seqpacket</code> specifies a sequenced packet stream
connection.  Both connections and servers can be of these types.

          <br><dt>:server <var>server-flag</var><dd>If <var>server-flag</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, create a server.  Otherwise,
create a connection.  For a stream type server, <var>server-flag</var> may
be an integer, which then specifies the length of the queue of pending
connections to the server.  The default queue length is 5.

          <br><dt>:host <var>host</var><dd>Specify the host to connect to.  <var>host</var> should be a host name or
Internet address, as a string, or the symbol <code>local</code> to specify
the local host.  If you specify <var>host</var> for a server, it must
specify a valid address for the local host, and only clients
connecting to that address will be accepted.

          <br><dt>:service <var>service</var><dd><var>service</var> specifies a port number to connect to; or, for a server,
the port number to listen on.  It should be a service name like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"http"</span></samp>&rsquo; that translates to a port number, or an integer like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">80</span></samp>&rsquo;
or an integer string like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"80"</span></samp>&rsquo; that specifies the port number
directly.  For a server, it can also be <code>t</code>, which means to let
the system select an unused port number.

          <br><dt>:family <var>family</var><dd><var>family</var> specifies the address (and protocol) family for
communication.  <code>nil</code> means determine the proper address family
automatically for the given <var>host</var> and <var>service</var>. 
<code>local</code> specifies a Unix socket, in which case <var>host</var> is
ignored.  <code>ipv4</code> and <code>ipv6</code> specify to use IPv4 and IPv6,
respectively.

          <br><dt>:use-external-socket <var>use-external-socket</var><dd>If <var>use-external-socket</var> is non-<code>nil</code> use any sockets passed
to Emacs on invocation instead of allocating one.  This is used by the
Emacs server code to allow on-demand socket activation.  If Emacs
wasn't passed a socket, this option is silently ignored.

          <br><dt>:local <var>local-address</var><dd>For a server process, <var>local-address</var> is the address to listen on. 
It overrides <var>family</var>, <var>host</var> and <var>service</var>, so you
might as well not specify them.

          <br><dt>:remote <var>remote-address</var><dd>For a connection, <var>remote-address</var> is the address to connect to. 
It overrides <var>family</var>, <var>host</var> and <var>service</var>, so you
might as well not specify them.

          <p>For a datagram server, <var>remote-address</var> specifies the initial
setting of the remote datagram address.

          <p>The format of <var>local-address</var> or <var>remote-address</var> depends on
the address family:

               <ul>
<li>An IPv4 address is represented as a five-element vector of four 8-bit
integers and one 16-bit integer
<code>[</code><var>a</var> <var>b</var> <var>c</var> <var>d</var> <var>p</var><code>]</code> corresponding to
numeric IPv4 address <var>a</var>.<var>b</var>.<var>c</var>.<var>d</var> and port number
<var>p</var>.

               <li>An IPv6 address is represented as a nine-element vector of 16-bit
integers <code>[</code><var>a</var> <var>b</var> <var>c</var> <var>d</var> <var>e</var> <var>f</var>
<var>g</var> <var>h</var> <var>p</var><code>]</code> corresponding to numeric IPv6 address
<var>a</var>:<var>b</var>:<var>c</var>:<var>d</var>:<var>e</var>:<var>f</var>:<var>g</var>:<var>h</var> and
port number <var>p</var>.

               <li>A local address is represented as a string, which specifies the address
in the local address space.

               <li>An unsupported-family address is represented by a cons
<code>(</code><var>f</var><code> . </code><var>av</var><code>)</code>, where <var>f</var> is the family number and
<var>av</var> is a vector specifying the socket address using one element
per address data byte.  Do not rely on this format in portable code,
as it may depend on implementation defined constants, data sizes, and
data structure alignment. 
</ul>

          <br><dt>:nowait <var>bool</var><dd>If <var>bool</var> is non-<code>nil</code> for a stream connection, return
without waiting for the connection to complete.  When the connection
succeeds or fails, Emacs will call the sentinel function, with a
second argument matching <code>"open"</code> (if successful) or
<code>"failed"</code>.  The default is to block, so that
<code>make-network-process</code> does not return until the connection has
succeeded or failed.

          <p>If you're setting up an asynchronous TLS connection, you have to also
provide the <code>:tls-parameters</code> parameter (see below).

          <p>Depending on the capabilities of Emacs, how asynchronous
<code>:nowait</code> is may vary.  The three elements that may (or may not)
be done asynchronously are domain name resolution, socket setup, and
(for TLS connections) TLS negotiation.

          <p>Many functions that interact with process objects, (for instance,
<code>process-datagram-address</code>) rely on them at least having a socket
before they can return a useful value.  These functions will block
until the socket has achieved the desired status.  The recommended way
of interacting with asynchronous sockets is to place a sentinel on the
process, and not try to interact with it before it has changed status
to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"run"</span></samp>&rsquo;.  That way, none of these functions will block.

          <br><dt>:tls-parameters<dd>When opening a TLS connection, this should be where the first element
is the TLS type (which should either be <code>gnutls-x509pki</code> or
<code>gnutls-anon</code>, and the remaining elements should form a keyword
list acceptable for <code>gnutls-boot</code>.  (This keyword list can be
obtained from the <code>gnutls-boot-parameters</code> function.)  The TLS
connection will then be negotiated after completing the connection to
the host.

          <br><dt>:stop <var>stopped</var><dd>If <var>stopped</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, start the network connection or
server in the stopped state.

          <br><dt>:buffer <var>buffer</var><dd>Use <var>buffer</var> as the process buffer.

          <br><dt>:coding <var>coding</var><dd>Use <var>coding</var> as the coding system for this process.  To specify
different coding systems for decoding data from the connection and for
encoding data sent to it, specify <code>(</code><var>decoding</var><code> . 
</code><var>encoding</var><code>)</code> for <var>coding</var>.

          <p>If you don't specify this keyword at all, the default
is to determine the coding systems from the data.

          <br><dt>:noquery <var>query-flag</var><dd>Initialize the process query flag to <var>query-flag</var>. 
See <a href="Query-Before-Exit.html#Query-Before-Exit">Query Before Exit</a>.

          <br><dt>:filter <var>filter</var><dd>Initialize the process filter to <var>filter</var>.

          <br><dt>:filter-multibyte <var>multibyte</var><dd>If <var>multibyte</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, strings given to the process
filter are multibyte, otherwise they are unibyte.  The default is the
default value of <code>enable-multibyte-characters</code>.

          <br><dt>:sentinel <var>sentinel</var><dd>Initialize the process sentinel to <var>sentinel</var>.

          <br><dt>:log <var>log</var><dd>Initialize the log function of a server process to <var>log</var>.  The log
function is called each time the server accepts a network connection
from a client.  The arguments passed to the log function are
<var>server</var>, <var>connection</var>, and <var>message</var>; where <var>server</var>
is the server process, <var>connection</var> is the new process for the
connection, and <var>message</var> is a string describing what has
happened.

          <br><dt>:plist <var>plist</var><dd>Initialize the process plist to <var>plist</var>. 
</dl>

        <p>The original argument list, modified with the actual connection
information, is available via the <code>process-contact</code> function.
