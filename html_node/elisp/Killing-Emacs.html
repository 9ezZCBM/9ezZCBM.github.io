<h4 class="subsection">40.2.1 Killing Emacs</h4>

<p><a name="index-killing-Emacs-5116"></a>
  Killing Emacs means ending the execution of the Emacs process. 
If you started Emacs from a terminal, the parent process normally
resumes control.  The low-level primitive for killing Emacs is
<code>kill-emacs</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>kill-emacs</b><var> &amp;optional exit-data<a name="index-kill_002demacs-5117"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command calls the hook <code>kill-emacs-hook</code>, then exits the
Emacs process and kills it.

        <p>If <var>exit-data</var> is an integer, that is used as the exit status of
the Emacs process.  (This is useful primarily in batch operation; see
<a href="Batch-Mode.html#Batch-Mode">Batch Mode</a>.)

        <p>If <var>exit-data</var> is a string, its contents are stuffed into the
terminal input buffer so that the shell (or whatever program next reads
input) can read them. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-SIGTERM-5118"></a><a name="index-SIGHUP-5119"></a><a name="index-SIGINT-5120"></a><a name="index-operating-system-signal-5121"></a>  The <code>kill-emacs</code> function is normally called via the
higher-level command <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd>
(<code>save-buffers-kill-terminal</code>).  See <a href="../emacs/Exiting.html#Exiting">Exiting</a>.  It is also called automatically if Emacs receives a
<code>SIGTERM</code> or <code>SIGHUP</code> operating system signal (e.g., when the
controlling terminal is disconnected), or if it receives a
<code>SIGINT</code> signal while running in batch mode (see <a href="Batch-Mode.html#Batch-Mode">Batch Mode</a>).

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>kill-emacs-hook</b><var><a name="index-kill_002demacs_002dhook-5122"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This normal hook is run by <code>kill-emacs</code>, before it kills Emacs.

        <p>Because <code>kill-emacs</code> can be called in situations where user
interaction is impossible (e.g., when the terminal is disconnected),
functions on this hook should not attempt to interact with the user. 
If you want to interact with the user when Emacs is shutting down, use
<code>kill-emacs-query-functions</code>, described below. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>When Emacs is killed, all the information in the Emacs process,
aside from files that have been saved, is lost.  Because killing Emacs
inadvertently can lose a lot of work, the
<code>save-buffers-kill-terminal</code> command queries for confirmation if
you have buffers that need saving or subprocesses that are running. 
It also runs the abnormal hook <code>kill-emacs-query-functions</code>:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>kill-emacs-query-functions</b><var><a name="index-kill_002demacs_002dquery_002dfunctions-5123"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>When <code>save-buffers-kill-terminal</code> is killing Emacs, it calls the
functions in this hook, after asking the standard questions and before
calling <code>kill-emacs</code>.  The functions are called in order of
appearance, with no arguments.  Each function can ask for additional
confirmation from the user.  If any of them returns <code>nil</code>,
<code>save-buffers-kill-emacs</code> does not kill Emacs, and does not run
the remaining functions in this hook.  Calling <code>kill-emacs</code>
directly does not run this hook. 
</p></blockquote></div>
