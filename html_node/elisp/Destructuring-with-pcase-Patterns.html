<h4 class="subsection">11.4.4 Destructuring with <code>pcase</code> Patterns</h4>

<p><a name="index-destructuring-with-pcase-patterns-733"></a>
Pcase patterns not only express a condition on the form of the objects
they can match, but they can also extract sub-fields of those objects. 
For example we can extract 2 elements from a list that is the value of
the variable <code>my-list</code> with the following code:

<pre class="example">       (pcase my-list
         (`(add ,x ,y)  (message "Contains %S and %S" x y)))
</pre>
   <p>This will not only extract <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> but will additionally
test that <code>my-list</code> is a list containing exactly 3 elements and
whose first element is the symbol <code>add</code>.  If any of those tests
fail, <code>pcase</code> will immediately return <code>nil</code> without calling
<code>message</code>.

   <p>Extraction of multiple values stored in an object is known as
<dfn>destructuring</dfn>.  Using <code>pcase</code> patterns allows to perform
<dfn>destructuring binding</dfn>, which is similar to a local binding
(see <a href="Local-Variables.html#Local-Variables">Local Variables</a>), but gives values to multiple elements of
a variable by extracting those values from an object of compatible
structure.

   <p>The macros described in this section use <code>pcase</code> patterns to
perform destructuring binding.  The condition of the object to be of
compatible structure means that the object must match the pattern,
because only then the object's subfields can be extracted.  For
example:

<pre class="example">       (pcase-let ((`(add ,x ,y) my-list))
         (message "Contains %S and %S" x y))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">does the same as the previous example, except that it directly tries
to extract <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> from <code>my-list</code> without first
verifying if <code>my-list</code> is a list which has the right number of
elements and has <code>add</code> as its first element.  The precise
behavior when the object does not actually match the pattern is
undefined, although the body will not be silently skipped: either an
error is signaled or the body is run with some of the variables
potentially bound to arbitrary values like <code>nil</code>.

   <p>The pcase patterns that are useful for destructuring bindings are
generally those described in <a href="Backquote-Patterns.html#Backquote-Patterns">Backquote Patterns</a>, since they
express a specification of the structure of objects that will match.

   <p>For an alternative facility for destructuring binding, see
<a href="seq_002dlet.html#seq_002dlet">seq-let</a>.

        <p>All <var>exp</var>s are evaluated first, after which they are matched

        <p>Unlike <code>pcase-let</code>, but similarly to <code>let*</code>, each <var>exp</var>

the next element of <var>bindings</var>, so the variable bindings
