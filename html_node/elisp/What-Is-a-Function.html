<h3 class="section">13.1 What Is a Function?</h3>

<p><a name="index-return-value-923"></a><a name="index-value-of-function-924"></a><a name="index-argument-925"></a>  In a general sense, a function is a rule for carrying out a
computation given input values called <dfn>arguments</dfn>.  The result of
the computation is called the <dfn>value</dfn> or <dfn>return value</dfn> of the
function.  The computation can also have side effects, such as lasting
changes in the values of variables or the contents of data structures.

   <p>In most computer languages, every function has a name.  But in Lisp,
a function in the strictest sense has no name: it is an object which
can <em>optionally</em> be associated with a symbol (e.g., <code>car</code>)
that serves as the function name.  See <a href="Function-Names.html#Function-Names">Function Names</a>.  When a
function has been given a name, we usually also refer to that symbol
as a &ldquo;function&rdquo; (e.g., we refer to &ldquo;the function <code>car</code>&rdquo;). 
In this manual, the distinction between a function name and the
function object itself is usually unimportant, but we will take note
wherever it is relevant.

   <p>Certain function-like objects, called <dfn>special forms</dfn> and
<dfn>macros</dfn>, also accept arguments to carry out computations. 
However, as explained below, these are not considered functions in
Emacs Lisp.

   <p>Here are important terms for functions and function-like objects:

     <dl>
<dt><dfn>lambda expression</dfn><dd>A function (in the strict sense, i.e., a function object) which is
written in Lisp.  These are described in the following section. 
See <a href="Lambda-Expressions.html#Lambda-Expressions">Lambda Expressions</a>.

     <br><dt><dfn>primitive</dfn><dd><a name="index-primitive-926"></a><a name="index-subr-927"></a><a name="index-built_002din-function-928"></a>A function which is callable from Lisp but is actually written in C. 
Primitives are also called <dfn>built-in functions</dfn>, or <dfn>subrs</dfn>. 
Examples include functions like <code>car</code> and <code>append</code>.  In
addition, all special forms (see below) are also considered
primitives.

     <p>Usually, a function is implemented as a primitive because it is a
fundamental part of Lisp (e.g., <code>car</code>), or because it provides a
low-level interface to operating system services, or because it needs
to run fast.  Unlike functions defined in Lisp, primitives can be
modified or added only by changing the C sources and recompiling
Emacs.  See <a href="Writing-Emacs-Primitives.html#Writing-Emacs-Primitives">Writing Emacs Primitives</a>.

     <br><dt><dfn>special form</dfn><dd>A primitive that is like a function but does not evaluate all of its
arguments in the usual way.  It may evaluate only some of the
arguments, or may evaluate them in an unusual order, or several times. 
Examples include <code>if</code>, <code>and</code>, and <code>while</code>. 
See <a href="Special-Forms.html#Special-Forms">Special Forms</a>.

     <br><dt><dfn>macro</dfn><dd><a name="index-macro-929"></a>A construct defined in Lisp, which differs from a function in that it
translates a Lisp expression into another expression which is to be
evaluated instead of the original expression.  Macros enable Lisp
programmers to do the sorts of things that special forms can do. 
See <a href="Macros.html#Macros">Macros</a>.

     <br><dt><dfn>command</dfn><dd><a name="index-command-930"></a>An object which can be invoked via the <code>command-execute</code>
primitive, usually due to the user typing in a key sequence
<dfn>bound</dfn> to that command.  See <a href="Interactive-Call.html#Interactive-Call">Interactive Call</a>.  A command is
usually a function; if the function is written in Lisp, it is made
into a command by an <code>interactive</code> form in the function
definition (see <a href="Defining-Commands.html#Defining-Commands">Defining Commands</a>).  Commands that are functions
can also be called from Lisp expressions, just like other functions.

     <p>Keyboard macros (strings and vectors) are commands also, even though
they are not functions.  See <a href="Keyboard-Macros.html#Keyboard-Macros">Keyboard Macros</a>.  We say that a symbol
is a command if its function cell contains a command (see <a href="Symbol-Components.html#Symbol-Components">Symbol Components</a>); such a <dfn>named command</dfn> can be invoked with
<kbd>M-x</kbd>.

     <br><dt><dfn>closure</dfn><dd>A function object that is much like a lambda expression, except that
it also encloses an environment of lexical variable bindings. 
See <a href="Closures.html#Closures">Closures</a>.

     <br><dt><dfn>byte-code function</dfn><dd>A function that has been compiled by the byte compiler. 
See <a href="Byte_002dCode-Type.html#Byte_002dCode-Type">Byte-Code Type</a>.

     <br><dt><dfn>autoload object</dfn><dd><a name="index-autoload-object-931"></a>A place-holder for a real function.  If the autoload object is called,
Emacs loads the file containing the definition of the real function,
and then calls the real function.  See <a href="Autoload.html#Autoload">Autoload</a>. 
</dl>

   <p>You can use the function <code>functionp</code> to test if an object is a
function:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>functionp</b><var> object<a name="index-functionp-932"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if <var>object</var> is any kind of
function, i.e., can be passed to <code>funcall</code>.  Note that
<code>functionp</code> returns <code>t</code> for symbols that are function names,
and returns <code>nil</code> for special forms. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>It is also possible to find out how many arguments an arbitrary
function expects:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>func-arity</b><var> function<a name="index-func_002darity-933"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function provides information about the argument list of the
specified <var>function</var>.  The returned value is a cons cell of the
form <code>(</code><var>min</var><code>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</code><var>max</var><code>)</code><!-- /@w -->, where <var>min</var> is the
minimum number of arguments, and <var>max</var> is either the maximum
number of arguments, or the symbol <code>many</code> for functions with
<code>&amp;rest</code> arguments, or the symbol <code>unevalled</code> if
<var>function</var> is a special form.

        <p>Note that this function might return inaccurate results in some
situations, such as the following:

          <ul>
<li>Functions defined using <code>apply-partially</code> (see <a href="Calling-Functions.html#Calling-Functions">apply-partially</a>).

          <li>Functions that are advised using <code>advice-add</code> (see <a href="Advising-Named-Functions.html#Advising-Named-Functions">Advising Named Functions</a>).

          <li>Functions that determine the argument list dynamically, as part of
their code. 
</ul>

        </blockquote></div>

<p class="noindent">Unlike <code>functionp</code>, the next three functions do <em>not</em> treat
a symbol as its function definition.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>subrp</b><var> object<a name="index-subrp-934"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if <var>object</var> is a built-in function
(i.e., a Lisp primitive).

     <pre class="example">          (subrp 'message)            ; <code>message</code><span class="roman"> is a symbol,</span>
               &rArr; nil                 ;   <span class="roman">not a subr object.</span>
          (subrp (symbol-function 'message))
               &rArr; t
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>byte-code-function-p</b><var> object<a name="index-byte_002dcode_002dfunction_002dp-935"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if <var>object</var> is a byte-code
function.  For example:

     <pre class="example">          (byte-code-function-p (symbol-function 'next-line))
               &rArr; t
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>subr-arity</b><var> subr<a name="index-subr_002darity-936"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This works like <code>func-arity</code>, but only for built-in functions and
without symbol indirection.  It signals an error for non-built-in
functions.  We recommend to use <code>func-arity</code> instead. 
</p></blockquote></div>
