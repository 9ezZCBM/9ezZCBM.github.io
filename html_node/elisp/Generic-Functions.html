<h3 class="section">13.8 Generic Functions</h3>

<p><a name="index-generic-functions-987"></a><a name="index-polymorphism-988"></a>
  Functions defined using <code>defun</code> have a hard-coded set of
assumptions about the types and expected values of their arguments. 
For example, a function that was designed to handle values of its
argument that are either numbers or lists of numbers will fail or
signal an error if called with a value of any other type, such as a
vector or a string.  This happens because the implementation of the
function is not prepared to deal with types other than those assumed
during the design.

   <p>By contrast, object-oriented programs use <dfn>polymorphic
functions</dfn>: a set of specialized functions having the same name, each
one of which was written for a certain specific set of argument types. 
Which of the functions is actually called is decided at run time based
on the types of the actual arguments.

   <p><a name="index-CLOS-989"></a>  Emacs provides support for polymorphism.  Like other Lisp
environments, notably Common Lisp and its Common Lisp Object System
(<acronym>CLOS</acronym>), this support is based on <dfn>generic functions</dfn>. 
The Emacs generic functions closely follow <acronym>CLOS</acronym>, including
use of similar names, so if you have experience with <acronym>CLOS</acronym>,
the rest of this section will sound very familiar.

   <p>A generic function specifies an abstract operation, by defining its
name and list of arguments, but (usually) no implementation.  The
actual implementation for several specific classes of arguments is
provided by <dfn>methods</dfn>, which should be defined separately.  Each
method that implements a generic function has the same name as the
generic function, but the method's definition indicates what kinds of
arguments it can handle by <dfn>specializing</dfn> the arguments defined by
the generic function.  These <dfn>argument specializers</dfn> can be more
or less specific; for example, a <code>string</code> type is more specific
than a more general type, such as <code>sequence</code>.

   <p>Note that, unlike in message-based OO languages, such as C<tt>++</tt> and
Simula, methods that implement generic functions don't belong to a
class, they belong to the generic function they implement.

   <p>When a generic function is invoked, it selects the applicable
methods by comparing the actual arguments passed by the caller with
the argument specializers of each method.  A method is applicable if
the actual arguments of the call are compatible with the method's
specializers.  If more than one method is applicable, they are
combined using certain rules, described below, and the combination
then handles the call.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>cl-defgeneric</b><var> name arguments </var>[<var>documentation</var>] [<var>options-and-methods<small class="dots">...</small></var>]<var> &amp;rest body<a name="index-cl_002ddefgeneric-990"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This macro defines a generic function with the specified <var>name</var>
and <var>arguments</var>.  If <var>body</var> is present, it provides the
default implementation.  If <var>documentation</var> is present (it should
always be), it specifies the documentation string for the generic
function, in the form <code>(:documentation </code><var>docstring</var><code>)</code>.  The
optional <var>options-and-methods</var> can be one of the following forms:

          <dl>
<dt><code>(declare </code><var>declarations</var><code>)</code><dd>A declare form, as described in <a href="Declare-Form.html#Declare-Form">Declare Form</a>. 
<br><dt><code>(:argument-precedence-order &amp;rest </code><var>args</var><code>)</code><dd>This form affects the sorting order for combining applicable methods. 
Normally, when two methods are compared during combination, method
arguments are examined left to right, and the first method whose
argument specializer is more specific will come before the other one. 
The order defined by this form overrides that, and the arguments are
examined according to their order in this form, and not left to right. 
<br><dt><code>(:method [</code><var>qualifiers</var><code>...] args &amp;rest body)</code><dd>This form defines a method like <code>cl-defmethod</code> does. 
</dl>
        </p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>cl-defmethod</b><var> name </var>[<var>qualifier</var>]<var> arguments &amp;rest </var>[<var>docstring</var>]<var> body<a name="index-cl_002ddefmethod-991"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This macro defines a particular implementation for the generic
function called <var>name</var>.  The implementation code is given by
<var>body</var>.  If present, <var>docstring</var> is the documentation string
for the method.  The <var>arguments</var> list, which must be identical in
all the methods that implement a generic function, and must match the
argument list of that function, provides argument specializers of the
form <code>(</code><var>arg</var> <var>spec</var><code>)</code>, where <var>arg</var> is the argument
name as specified in the <code>cl-defgeneric</code> call, and <var>spec</var> is
one of the following specializer forms:

          <dl>
<dt><var>type</var><dd>This specializer requires the argument to be of the given <var>type</var>,
one of the types from the type hierarchy described below. 
<br><dt><code>(eql </code><var>object</var><code>)</code><dd>This specializer requires the argument be <code>eql</code> to the given
<var>object</var>. 
<br><dt><code>(head </code><var>object</var><code>)</code><dd>The argument must be a cons cell whose <code>car</code> is <code>eql</code> to
<var>object</var>. 
<br><dt><var>struct-type</var><dd>The argument must be an instance of a class named <var>struct-type</var>
defined with <code>cl-defstruct</code> (see <a href="../cl/Structures.html#Structures">Structures</a>), or of one of its child classes. 
</dl>

        <p>Alternatively, the argument specializer can be of the form
<code>&amp;context (</code><var>expr</var> <var>spec</var><code>)</code>, in which case the value of
<var>expr</var> must be compatible with the specializer provided by
<var>spec</var>; <var>spec</var> can be any of the forms described above.  In
other words, this form of specializer uses the value of <var>expr</var>
instead of arguments for the decision whether the method is
applicable.  For example, <code>&amp;context (overwrite-mode (eql t))</code>
will make the method compatible only when <code>overwrite-mode</code> is
turned on.

        <p>The type specializer, <code>(</code><var>arg</var> <var>type</var><code>)</code>, can specify one
of the <dfn>system types</dfn> in the following list.  When a parent type
is specified, an argument whose type is any of its more specific child
types, as well as grand-children, grand-grand-children, etc. will also
be compatible.

          <dl>
<dt><code>integer</code><dd>Parent type: <code>number</code>. 
<br><dt><code>number</code><br><dt><code>null</code><dd>Parent type: <code>symbol</code>
<br><dt><code>symbol</code><br><dt><code>string</code><dd>Parent type: <code>array</code>. 
<br><dt><code>array</code><dd>Parent type: <code>sequence</code>. 
<br><dt><code>cons</code><dd>Parent type: <code>list</code>. 
<br><dt><code>list</code><dd>Parent type: <code>sequence</code>. 
<br><dt><code>marker</code><br><dt><code>overlay</code><br><dt><code>float</code><dd>Parent type: <code>number</code>.

<br><dt><code>frame</code><br><dt><code>hash-table</code><br><dt><code>font-spec</code><br><dt><code>font-entity</code><br><dt><code>font-object</code><dd></dl>

        <p>The optional <var>qualifier</var> allows combining several applicable
methods.  If it is not present, the defined method is a <dfn>primary</dfn>
method, responsible for providing the primary implementation of the
generic function for the specialized arguments.  You can also define
<dfn>auxiliary methods</dfn>, by using one of the following values as
<var>qualifier</var>:

          <dl>
<dt><code>:before</code><dd>This auxiliary method will run before the primary method.  More
accurately, all the <code>:before</code> methods will run before the
primary, in the most-specific-first order. 
<br><dt><code>:after</code><dd>This auxiliary method will run after the primary method.  More
accurately, all such methods will run after the primary, in the
most-specific-last order. 
<br><dt><code>:around</code><dd>This auxiliary method will run <em>instead</em> of the primary method. 
The most specific of such methods will be run before any other method. 
Such methods normally use <code>cl-call-next-method</code>, described below,
to invoke the other auxiliary or primary methods. 
<br><dt><code>:extra </code><var>string</var><dd>This allows you to add more methods, distinguished by <var>string</var>,
for the same specializers and qualifiers. 
</dl>

        <p>Functions defined using <code>cl-defmethod</code> cannot be made
interactive, i.e. commands (see <a href="Defining-Commands.html#Defining-Commands">Defining Commands</a>), by adding
the <code>interactive</code> form to them.  If you need a polymorphic
command, we recommend defining a normal command that calls a
polymorphic function defined via <code>cl-defgeneric</code> and
<code>cl-defmethod</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-dispatch-of-methods-for-generic-function-992"></a><a name="index-multiple_002ddispatch-methods-993"></a>Each time a generic function is called, it builds the <dfn>effective
method</dfn> which will handle this invocation by combining the applicable
methods defined for the function.  The process of finding the
applicable methods and producing the effective method is called
<dfn>dispatch</dfn>.  The applicable methods are those all of whose
specializers are compatible with the actual arguments of the call. 
Since all of the arguments must be compatible with the specializers,
they all determine whether a method is applicable.  Methods that
explicitly specialize more than one argument are called
<dfn>multiple-dispatch methods</dfn>.

   <p>The applicable methods are sorted into the order in which they will be
combined.  The method whose left-most argument specializer is the most
specific one will come first in the order.  (Specifying
<code>:argument-precedence-order</code> as part of <code>cl-defmethod</code>
overrides that, as described above.)  If the method body calls
<code>cl-call-next-method</code>, the next most-specific method will run. 
If there are applicable <code>:around</code> methods, the most-specific of
them will run first; it should call <code>cl-call-next-method</code> to run
any of the less specific <code>:around</code> methods.  Next, the
<code>:before</code> methods run in the order of their specificity, followed
by the primary method, and lastly the <code>:after</code> methods in the
reverse order of their specificity.

<blockquote><p>When invoked from within the lexical body of a primary or an
<code>:around</code> auxiliary method, call the next applicable method for
the same generic function.  Normally, it is called with no arguments,
which means to call the next applicable method with the same arguments
that the calling method was invoked.  Otherwise, the specified
arguments are used instead.
