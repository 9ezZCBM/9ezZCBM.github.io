<h3 class="section">37.3 Condition Variables</h3>

<p>A <dfn>condition variable</dfn> is a way for a thread to block until some
event occurs.  A thread can wait on a condition variable, to be woken
up when some other thread notifies the condition.

   <p>A condition variable is associated with a mutex and, conceptually,
with some condition.  For proper operation, the mutex must be
acquired, and then a waiting thread must loop, testing the condition
and waiting on the condition variable.  For example:

<pre class="example">     (with-mutex mutex
       (while (not global-variable)
         (condition-wait cond-var)))
</pre>
   <p>The mutex ensures atomicity, and the loop is for robustness&mdash;there
may be spurious notifications.

   <p>Similarly, the mutex must be held before notifying the condition. 
The typical, and best, approach is to acquire the mutex, make the
changes associated with this condition, and then notify it:

<pre class="example">     (with-mutex mutex
       (setq global-variable (some-computation))
       (condition-notify cond-var))
</pre>
   <div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>make-condition-variable</b><var> mutex &amp;optional name<a name="index-make_002dcondition_002dvariable-4333"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Make a new condition variable associated with <var>mutex</var>.  If
<var>name</var> is specified, it is a name given to the condition variable. 
It must be a string.  The name is for debugging purposes only; it has
no meaning to Emacs. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>condition-variable-p</b><var> object<a name="index-condition_002dvariable_002dp-4334"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if <var>object</var> represents a condition
variable, <code>nil</code> otherwise. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>condition-wait</b><var> cond<a name="index-condition_002dwait-4335"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Wait for another thread to notify <var>cond</var>, a condition variable. 
This function will block until the condition is notified, or until a
signal is delivered to this thread using <code>thread-signal</code>.

        <p>It is an error to call <code>condition-wait</code> without holding the
condition's associated mutex.

        <p><code>condition-wait</code> releases the associated mutex while waiting. 
This allows other threads to acquire the mutex in order to notify the
condition. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>condition-notify</b><var> cond &amp;optional all<a name="index-condition_002dnotify-4336"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Notify <var>cond</var>.  The mutex with <var>cond</var> must be held before
calling this.  Ordinarily a single waiting thread is woken by
<code>condition-notify</code>; but if <var>all</var> is not <code>nil</code>, then all
threads waiting on <var>cond</var> are notified.

        <p><code>condition-notify</code> releases the associated mutex while waiting. 
This allows other threads to acquire the mutex in order to wait on the
condition. 
<!-- why bother? -->
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>condition-name</b><var> cond<a name="index-condition_002dname-4337"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Return the name of <var>cond</var>, as passed to
<code>make-condition-variable</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>condition-mutex</b><var> cond<a name="index-condition_002dmutex-4338"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Return the mutex associated with <var>cond</var>.  Note that the associated
mutex cannot be changed.
