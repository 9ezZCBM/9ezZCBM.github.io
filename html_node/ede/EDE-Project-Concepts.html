<h2 class="chapter">1 <i>EDE</i> Project Concepts</h2>

<p><i>EDE</i> is a generic interface for managing projects.  It specifies a
single set of menus and keybindings, while supporting multiple ways to
express a project via a build system.

   <p>In the subsequent chapters, we will describe the different project
types (see <a href="Creating-a-project.html#Creating-a-project">Creating a project</a>), as well as the commands to build
and debug projects (see <a href="Building-and-Debugging.html#Building-and-Debugging">Building and Debugging</a>).

   <p>In <i>EDE</i>, a project hierarchy matches a directory hierarchy.  The
project's topmost directory is called the <dfn>project root</dfn>, and its
subdirectories are <dfn>subprojects</dfn>.

   <p>Each project can contain multiple <dfn>targets</dfn>.  A target, at the
simplest level, is a named collection of files within a project.  A
target can specify two different types of information:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>A collection of files to be added to a distribution (e.g., a tarball
that you intend to distribute to others).

     <li>A collection of files that can be built into something else (e.g., a
program or compiled documentation).
        </ol>

   <p>Lastly, <i>EDE</i> provides a way for other tools to easily learn file
associations.  For example, a program might need to restrict some sort
of search to files in a single target, or to discover the location of
documentation or interface files.  <i>EDE</i> can provide this
information.
