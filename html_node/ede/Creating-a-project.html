<h2 class="chapter">4 Creating a project</h2>

<p>To create a new project, first visit a file that you want to include
in that project.  If you have a hierarchy of directories, first visit
a file in the topmost directory.  From this buffer, type <kbd>M-x
ede-new</kbd>, or click on the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Create Project</span></samp>&rsquo; item in the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Development</span></samp>&rsquo; menu.

   <p>The <samp><span class="command">ede-new</span></samp> command prompts for the type of project you
would like to create.  Each project type has its own benefits or
language specific enhancements.  Not all projects that <i>EDE</i> supports
also allow creating a new project.  Projects such as <code>emacs</code>
or <code>linux</code> are designed to recognize existing projects only. 
Project types such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Make</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Automake</span></samp>&rsquo; do support
creating new project types with <samp><span class="command">ede-new</span></samp>.

     <ul>
<li>For the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Make</span></samp>&rsquo; project type, <i>EDE</i> creates a <dfn>project file</dfn>,
called <samp><span class="file">Project.ede</span></samp>, in each project directory.  Information
about the project is stored in this file.  This project autogenerates
a <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>.

     <li>For the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Automake</span></samp>&rsquo; project type, <i>EDE</i> creates a
<samp><span class="file">Project.ede</span></samp> project file similar to a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Make</span></samp>&rsquo; project. 
Unlike a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Make</span></samp>&rsquo; project, this project autogenerates a
<samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> file.  <i>EDE</i> handles the Automake bootstrapping
routines, which import and maintain a <samp><span class="file">configure.am</span></samp> script and
other required files. 
</ul>

   <p>A subproject is merely a project in a subdirectory of another project. 
You can create a subproject by using the <samp><span class="command">ede-new</span></samp> command (or
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Create Project</span></samp>&rsquo; menu item), while visiting a buffer in a
subdirectory of the project root.  This new project is automatically
added to the parent project, and will be automatically loaded when
<i>EDE</i> reads the parent project.

   <p>When using a project command that involves a makefile, <i>EDE</i> uses
the top-most project's makefile as a starting place for the build.  How
the toplevel project handles subprojects in the build process is
dependent on that project's type.
