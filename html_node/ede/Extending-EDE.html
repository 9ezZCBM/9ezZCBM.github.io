<h2 class="chapter">8 Extending <i>EDE</i></h2>

<p>This chapter is intended for users who want to write new parts or fix
bugs in <i>EDE</i>.  A knowledge of Emacs Lisp, and some <i>EIEIO</i>(CLOS) is
required.

   <p><i>EDE</i> uses <i>EIEIO</i>, the CLOS package for Emacs, to define two object
superclasses, specifically the PROJECT and TARGET.  All commands in
<i>EDE</i> are usually meant to address the current project, or current
target.

   <p>All specific projects in <i>EDE</i> derive subclasses of the <i>EDE</i>
superclasses.  In this way, specific behaviors such as how a project
is saved, or how a target is compiled can be customized by a project
author in detail.  <i>EDE</i> communicates to these project objects via an
API using methods.  The commands you use in <i>EDE</i> mode are high-level
functional wrappers over these methods.  See <a href="../eieio/index.html#Top">Top</a>. For
details on using <i>EIEIO</i> to extending classes, and writing methods.

   <p>If you intend to extend <i>EDE</i>, it is most likely that a new target type is
needed in one of the existing project types.  The rest of this chapter
will discuss extending the <code>ede-project</code> class, and its targets. 
See <samp><span class="file">project-am.el</span></samp> for basic details on adding targets to it.

   <p>For the <code>ede-project</code> type, the core target class is called
<code>ede-proj-target</code>.  Inheriting from this will give you everything
you need to start, including adding your sources into the makefile.  If
you also need additional rules in the makefile, you will want to inherit
from <code>ede-proj-target-makefile</code> instead.  You may want to also add
new fields to track important information.

   <p>If you are building currently unsupported code into a program or shared
library, it is unlikely you need a new target at all.  Instead you
would need to create a new compiler or linker object that compiles
source code of the desired type. <a href="Compiler-and-Linker-objects.html#Compiler-and-Linker-objects">Compiler and Linker objects</a>.

   <p>Once your new class exists, you will want to fill in some basic methods. 
See the <samp><span class="file">ede-skel.el</span></samp> file for examples of these.  The files
<samp><span class="file">ede-proj-info.el</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">ede-proj-elisp.el</span></samp> are two interesting
examples.
