<p><a name="index-cvs_002dupdate-16"></a><a name="index-cvs_002dexamine-17"></a><a name="index-cvs_002dstatus-18"></a><a name="index-cvs_002dcheckout-19"></a><a name="index-cvs_002dquickdir-20"></a><a name="index-Creating-the-_002acvs_002a-buffer-21"></a>
Most commands in PCL-CVS require that you have a <samp><span class="file">*cvs*</span></samp>
buffer.  The commands that you use to get one are listed below. 
For each, a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs</span></samp>&rsquo; process will be run, the output will be parsed by
PCL-CVS, and the result will be printed in the <samp><span class="file">*cvs*</span></samp> buffer (see
<a href="Buffer-contents.html#Buffer-contents">Buffer contents</a>, for a description of the buffer's contents).

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x cvs-update</kbd><dd>Run a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs update</span></samp>&rsquo; command.  You will be asked for the directory
in which the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs update</span></samp>&rsquo; will be run.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x cvs-examine</kbd><dd>Run a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs -n update</span></samp>&rsquo; command.  This is identical to the previous
command, except that it will only check what needs to be done but will
not change anything.  You will be asked for the directory in
which the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs -n update</span></samp>&rsquo; will be run.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x cvs-status</kbd><dd>Run a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs status</span></samp>&rsquo; command.  You will be asked for the directory
in which the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs status</span></samp>&rsquo; will be run.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x cvs-checkout</kbd><dd>Run a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs checkout</span></samp>&rsquo; command.  You will be asked for the directory
in which the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs update</span></samp>&rsquo; will be run and the module to be checked
out.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x cvs-quickdir</kbd><dd>Populate the <samp><span class="file">*cvs*</span></samp> buffer by just looking at the <samp><span class="file">CVS/Entries</span></samp>
files.  This is very much like <code>cvs-examine</code> except that it does
not access the CVS repository, which is a major advantage when the
repository is far away.  But of course, it will not be able to detect
when a file needs to be updated or merged.

   <p><a name="index-cvs_002ddired_002daction-22"></a><a name="index-cvs_002ddired_002duse_002dhook-23"></a>The first four of
those commands are also reachable from the menu bar
under &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Tools-&gt;PCL-CVS</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Finally, an alternative way is to visit
the CVS administrative subdirectory in your work area with a simple
prefix argument.  For example <kbd>C-u C-x C-f ~/my/work/CVS &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  This
by default runs <code>cvs-quickdir</code> but the specific behavior can be
changed with <code>cvs-dired-action</code> and <code>cvs-dired-use-hook</code>.

   <p>By default, the commands above will descend recursively into
subdirectories.  You can avoid that behavior by including &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-l</span></samp>&rsquo; in
the flags for the command.  These flags can be set by giving a prefix
argument to the command (e.g., by typing
<kbd>C-u M-x cvs-update &lt;RET&gt; -l &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>).
