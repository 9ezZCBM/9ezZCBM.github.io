<h3 class="section">1.1 Contributors to PCL-CVS</h3>

<p><a name="index-Contributors-2"></a><a name="index-Authors-3"></a>
Contributions to the package are welcome.  I have limited time to work
on this project, but I will gladly add any code that you contribute to
me to this package (see <a href="Bugs.html#Bugs">Bugs</a>).

   <p>The following persons have made contributions to PCL-CVS.

     <ul>
<li>Brian Berliner wrote CVS, together with some other contributors. 
Without his work on CVS this package would be useless<small class="dots">...</small>

     <li>Per Cederqvist wrote most of the otherwise unattributed functions in
PCL-CVS as well as all the documentation.

     <li><!-- inge@@lysator.liu.se -->
Inge Wallin wrote the skeleton of
<samp><span class="file">pcl-cvs.texi</span></samp>, and gave useful comments on it.  He also wrote
the files <samp><span class="file">elib-node.el</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">compile-all.el</span></samp>.  The file
<samp><span class="file">cookie.el</span></samp> was inspired by Inge.

     <li><!-- linus@@lysator.liu.se -->
Linus Tolke contributed useful comments
on both the functionality and the documentation.

     <li><!-- jwz@@jwz.com -->
Jamie Zawinski contributed
<samp><span class="file">pcl-cvs-lucid.el</span></samp>, which was later renamed to
<samp><span class="file">pcl-cvs-xemacs.el</span></samp>.

     <li>Leif Lonnblad contributed RCVS support (since superseded by the new
remote CVS support).

     <li><!-- jimb@@cyclic.com -->
Jim Blandy contributed hooks to automatically
guess CVS log entries from <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> contents, and initial support of
the new Cygnus / Cyclic remote CVS, as well as various sundry bug fixes
and cleanups.

     <li><!-- kingdon@@cyclic.com -->
Jim Kingdon contributed lots of fixes to
the build and installation procedure.

     <li><!-- woods@@weird.com -->
Greg A. Woods contributed code to implement
the use of per-file diff buffers, and vendor join diffs with emerge and
ediff, as well as various and sundry bug fixes and cleanups.

     <li><!-- greg.klanderman@@alum.mit.edu -->
Greg Klanderman implemented
toggling of marked files, setting of CVS command flags via prefix
arguments, updated the XEmacs support, updated the manual, and fixed
numerous bugs.

     <li><!-- monnier@@gnu.org -->
Stefan Monnier added a slew of other
features and introduced even more new bugs.  If there's any bug left,
you can be sure it's his.

     <li><!-- wordy to avoid an underfull hbox -->
<!-- masata-y@@is.aist-nara.ac.jp -->
Masatake YAMATO made a gracious
contribution of his cvstree code to display a tree of tags which was later
superseded by the new <code>cvs-status-mode</code>. 
</ul>

   <p>Apart from these, a lot of people have sent us suggestions, ideas,
requests, bug reports and encouragement.  Thanks a lot!  Without you
there would be no new releases of PCL-CVS.
