If you find a bug or misfeature, don't hesitate to tell us! 
Use <kbd>M-x report-emacs-bug</kbd> to send us a report. 
You can follow the same process for feature requests. 
We prefer discussing one thing at a time.  If you find several unrelated
bugs, please report them separately.  If you are running PCL-CVS under
XEmacs, you should also send a copy of bug reports to
the <a href="http://lists.xemacs.org/mailman/listinfo/xemacs-beta">XEmacs mailing list</a>.

   <p>If you have problems using PCL-CVS or other questions, send them to
the <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-gnu-emacs">help-gnu-emacs mailing list</a>.  This is a good place to get help, as is
the <a href="http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/info-cvs">info-cvs list</a>.

   <p>If you have ideas for improvements, or if you have written some
extensions to this package, we would like to hear from you.  We hope that
you find this package useful!

   <p>Below is a partial list of currently known problems with PCL-CVS.

     <dl>
<dt>Unexpected output from CVS<dd>Unexpected output from CVS may confuse PCL-CVS.  It will create
warning messages in the <samp><span class="file">*cvs*</span></samp> buffer alerting you to any parse errors. 
If you get these messages, please send a bug report to the email
addresses listed above.  Include the contents of the <samp><span class="file">*cvs*</span></samp> buffer, the
output of the CVS process (which should be found in the <samp><span class="file"> *cvs-tmp*</span></samp>
buffer), and the versions of Emacs, PCL-CVS and CVS you are using.
