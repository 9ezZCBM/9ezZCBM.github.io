<h2 class="chapter">4 Selected files</h2>

<p><a name="index-Selected-files-9"></a><a name="index-Marked-files-10"></a><a name="index-File-selection-11"></a><a name="index-Active-files-12"></a><a name="index-Applicable-13"></a>
Many of the commands work on the current set of <dfn>selected</dfn> files
which can be either the set of marked files (if any file is marked and
marks are not ignored) or whichever file or directory the cursor is on.

   <p>If a directory is selected but the command cannot be applied to a
directory, then it will be applied to the set of files under this
directory which are in the <samp><span class="file">*cvs*</span></samp> buffer.

   <p><a name="index-cvs_002dmode_002dforce_002dcommand-14"></a><a name="index-cvs_002dallow_002ddir_002dcommit-15"></a>Furthermore, each command only operates on a subset of the selected
files, depending on whether or not the command is <dfn>applicable</dfn> to
each file (based on the file's status).  For example,
<code>cvs-mode-commit</code> is not applicable to a file whose status is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Need-Update</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If it should happen that PCL-CVS guesses the
applicability wrong, you can override it with the special prefix
<code>cvs-mode-force-command</code> normally bound to <kbd>M-f</kbd> (and file a
bug report).  The applicability rule can be slightly changed with
<code>cvs-allow-dir-commit</code> and <code>cvs-force-dir-tag</code>.

   <p>By default, marks are always in effect (you may change this, however, by
setting the variable <code>cvs-default-ignore-marks</code>) except for the
commands that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tag</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">diff</span></samp>&rsquo; a file (which can be changed
with the variable <code>cvs-invert-ignore-marks</code>).

   <p>In addition, you may use the special prefix <code>cvs-mode-toggle-marks</code>
normally bound to <kbd>T</kbd> to toggle the use of marks for the following
command.

   <p>This scheme might seem a little complicated, but once one gets used to
it, it is quite powerful.
