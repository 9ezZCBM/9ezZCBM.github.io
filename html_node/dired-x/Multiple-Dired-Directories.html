<h2 class="chapter">8 Multiple Dired Directories and Non-Dired Commands</h2>

<p><a name="index-Multiple-Dired-directories-70"></a><a name="index-Working-directory-71"></a>An Emacs buffer can have but one working directory, stored in the
buffer-local variable <code>default-directory</code>.  A Dired buffer may have
several subdirectories inserted, but it still has only one working
directory: that of the top-level Dired directory in that buffer.  For
some commands it is appropriate that they use the current Dired
directory instead of <code>default-directory</code>, e.g., <code>find-file</code> and
<code>compile</code>.

   <p><a name="index-dired_002dsmart_002dshell_002dcommand-72"></a><a name="index-shell_002dcommand-73"></a><a name="index-M_002d_0021-74"></a>The command <code>dired-smart-shell-command</code>, bound to <kbd>M-!</kbd> in
Dired buffers, is like <code>shell-command</code>, but it runs with
<code>default-directory</code> bound to the current Dired directory.
