<h2 class="unnumbered">Autotyping</h2>

<p>Under certain circumstances you will find yourself typing similar things
over and over again.  This is especially true of form letters and programming
language constructs.  Project-specific header comments, flow-control
constructs or magic numbers are essentially the same every time.  Emacs has
various features for doing tedious and repetitive typing chores for you
in addition to the Abbrev features (see <a href="../emacs/Abbrevs.html#Abbrevs">Abbrevs</a>).

   <p>One solution is using skeletons, flexible rules that say what to
insert, and how to do it.  Various programming language modes offer some
ready-to-use skeletons, and you can adapt them to suit your needs or
taste, or define new ones.

   <p>Another feature is automatic insertion of what you want into empty files,
depending on the file-name or the mode as appropriate.  You can have a file or
a skeleton inserted, or you can call a function.  Then there is the
possibility to have Un*x interpreter scripts automatically take on a magic
number and be executable as soon as they are saved.  Or you can have a
copyright notice's year updated, if necessary, every time you save a
file.  Similarly for time stamps in the file.

   <p>URLs can be inserted based on a word at point.  Flexible templates can
be defined for inserting and navigating between text more generally.  A
sort of meta-expansion facility can be used to try a set of alternative
completions and expansions of text at point.
