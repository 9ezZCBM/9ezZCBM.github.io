<h2 class="appendix">Appendix A History and Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>EWW was originally written by Lars Ingebrigtsen, known for his work on
Gnus.  He started writing an Emacs HTML rendering library,
<code>shr.el</code>, to read blogs in Gnus.  He eventually added a web
browser front end and HTML form support.  Which resulted in EWW, the
Emacs Web Wowser.  EWW was announced on 16 June 2013:
<a href="http://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2013/06/16/eww/">http://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2013/06/16/eww/</a>.

   <p>EWW was then moved from the Gnus repository to GNU Emacs and several
developers started contributing to it as well.
