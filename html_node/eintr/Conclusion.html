<h2 class="chapter">18 Conclusion</h2>

<p>We have now reached the end of this Introduction.  You have now
learned enough about programming in Emacs Lisp to set values, to write
simple <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> files for yourself and your friends, and write
simple customizations and extensions to Emacs.

   <p>This is a place to stop.  Or, if you wish, you can now go onward, and
teach yourself.

   <p>You have learned some of the basic nuts and bolts of programming.  But
only some.  There are a great many more brackets and hinges that are
easy to use that we have not touched.

   <p>A path you can follow right now lies among the sources to GNU Emacs
and in
<cite>The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</cite>.

   <p>The Emacs Lisp sources are an adventure.  When you read the sources and
come across a function or expression that is unfamiliar, you need to
figure out or find out what it does.

   <p>Go to the Reference Manual.  It is a thorough, complete, and fairly
easy-to-read description of Emacs Lisp.  It is written not only for
experts, but for people who know what you know.  (The <cite>Reference
Manual</cite> comes with the standard GNU Emacs distribution.  Like this
introduction, it comes as a Texinfo source file, so you can read it
on your computer and as a typeset, printed book.)

   <p>Go to the other built-in help that is part of GNU Emacs: the built-in
documentation for all functions and variables, and
<code>xref-find-definitions</code>, the program that takes you to sources.

   <p>Here is an example of how I explore the sources.  Because of its name,
<samp><span class="file">simple.el</span></samp> is the file I looked at first, a long time ago.  As
it happens some of the functions in <samp><span class="file">simple.el</span></samp> are complicated,
or at least look complicated at first sight.  The <code>open-line</code>
function, for example, looks complicated.

   <p>You may want to walk through this function slowly, as we did with the
<code>forward-sentence</code> function.  (See <a href="forward_002dsentence.html#forward_002dsentence">The <code>forward-sentence</code> function</a>.)  Or you may want to skip that
function and look at another, such as <code>split-line</code>.  You don't
need to read all the functions.  According to
<code>count-words-in-defun</code>, the <code>split-line</code> function contains
102 words and symbols.

   <p>Even though it is short, <code>split-line</code> contains  expressions
we have not studied: <code>skip-chars-forward</code>, <code>indent-to</code>,
<code>current-column</code> and <code>insert-and-inherit</code>.

   <p>Consider the <code>skip-chars-forward</code> function. 
In GNU Emacs, you can find out more about <code>skip-chars-forward</code> by
typing <kbd>C-h f</kbd> (<code>describe-function</code>) and the name of the
function.  This gives you the function documentation.

   <p>You may be able to guess what is done by a well named function such as
<code>indent-to</code>; or you can look it up, too.  Incidentally, the
<code>describe-function</code> function itself is in <samp><span class="file">help.el</span></samp>; it is
one of those long, but decipherable functions.  You can look up
<code>describe-function</code> using the <kbd>C-h f</kbd> command!

   <p>In this instance, since the code is Lisp, the <samp><span class="file">*Help*</span></samp> buffer
contains the name of the library containing the function's source. 
You can put point over the name of the library and press the &lt;RET&gt; key,
which in this situation is bound to <code>help-follow</code>, and be taken
directly to the source, in the same way as <kbd>M-.</kbd>
(<code>xref-find-definitions</code>).

   <p>The definition for <code>describe-function</code> illustrates how to
customize the <code>interactive</code> expression without using the standard
character codes; and it shows how to create a temporary buffer.

   <p>(The <code>indent-to</code> function is written in C rather than Emacs Lisp;
it is a built-in function.  <code>help-follow</code> takes you to its
source as does <code>xref-find-definitions</code>, when properly set up.)

   <p>You can look at a function's source using
<code>xref-find-definitions</code>, which is bound to <kbd>M-.</kbd>  Finally,
you can find out what the Reference Manual has to say by visiting the
manual in Info, and typing <kbd>i</kbd> (<code>Info-index</code>) and the name of
the function, or by looking up the function in the index to a printed
copy of the manual.

   <p>Similarly, you can find out what is meant by
<code>insert-and-inherit</code>.

   <p>Other interesting source files include <samp><span class="file">paragraphs.el</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">loaddefs.el</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="file">loadup.el</span></samp>.  The <samp><span class="file">paragraphs.el</span></samp>
file includes short, easily understood functions as well as longer
ones.  The <samp><span class="file">loaddefs.el</span></samp> file contains the many standard
autoloads and many keymaps.  I have never looked at it all; only at
parts.  <samp><span class="file">loadup.el</span></samp> is the file that loads the standard parts of
Emacs; it tells you a great deal about how Emacs is built. 
(See <a href="../elisp/Building-Emacs.html#Building-Emacs">Building Emacs</a>, for more about building.)

   <p>As I said, you have learned some nuts and bolts; however, and very
importantly, we have hardly touched major aspects of programming; I
have said nothing about how to sort information, except to use the
predefined <code>sort</code> function; I have said nothing about how to store
information, except to use variables and lists; I have said nothing
about how to write programs that write programs.  These are topics for
another, and different kind of book, a different kind of learning.

   <p>What you have done is learn enough for much practical work with GNU
Emacs.  What you have done is get started.  This is the end of a
beginning.
