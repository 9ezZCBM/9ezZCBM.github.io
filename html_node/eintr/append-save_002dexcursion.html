<h4 class="subsection">4.4.3 <code>save-excursion</code> in <code>append-to-buffer</code></h4>

<p>The body of the <code>let</code> expression in <code>append-to-buffer</code>
consists of a <code>save-excursion</code> expression.

   <p>The <code>save-excursion</code> function saves the location of point, and restores it
to that position after the expressions in the
body of the <code>save-excursion</code> complete execution.  In addition,
<code>save-excursion</code> keeps track of the original buffer, and
restores it.  This is how <code>save-excursion</code> is used in
<code>append-to-buffer</code>.

   <p><a name="index-Indentation-for-formatting-150"></a><a name="index-Formatting-convention-151"></a>Incidentally, it is worth noting here that a Lisp function is normally
formatted so that everything that is enclosed in a multi-line spread is
indented more to the right than the first symbol.  In this function
definition, the <code>let</code> is indented more than the <code>defun</code>, and
the <code>save-excursion</code> is indented more than the <code>let</code>, like
this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defun ...
       ...
       ...
       (let...
         (save-excursion
           ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This formatting convention makes it easy to see that the lines in
the body of the <code>save-excursion</code> are enclosed by the parentheses
associated with <code>save-excursion</code>, just as the
<code>save-excursion</code> itself is enclosed by the parentheses associated
with the <code>let</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     (let ((oldbuf (current-buffer)))
       (save-excursion
         ...
         (set-buffer ...)
         (insert-buffer-substring oldbuf start end)
         ...))
</pre>
   <p>The use of the <code>save-excursion</code> function can be viewed as a process
of filling in the slots of a template:

<pre class="smallexample">     (save-excursion
       <var>first-expression-in-body</var>
       <var>second-expression-in-body</var>
        ...
       <var>last-expression-in-body</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this function, the body of the <code>save-excursion</code> contains only
one expression, the <code>let*</code> expression.  You know about a
<code>let</code> function.  The <code>let*</code> function is different.  It has a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; in its name.  It enables Emacs to set each variable in its
varlist in sequence, one after another.

   <p>Its critical feature is that variables later in the varlist can make
use of the values to which Emacs set variables earlier in the varlist. 
See <a href="fwd_002dpara-let.html#fwd_002dpara-let">The <code>let*</code> expression</a>.

   <p>We will skip functions like <code>let*</code> and focus on two: the
<code>set-buffer</code> function and the <code>insert-buffer-substring</code>
function.

   <p>In the old days, the <code>set-buffer</code> expression was simply

<pre class="smallexample">     (set-buffer (get-buffer-create buffer))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">but now it is

<pre class="smallexample">     (set-buffer append-to)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><code>append-to</code> is bound to <code>(get-buffer-create buffer)</code> earlier
on in the <code>let*</code> expression.  That extra binding would not be
necessary except for that <code>append-to</code> is used later in the
varlist as an argument to <code>get-buffer-window-list</code>.

   <p>The <code>append-to-buffer</code> function definition inserts text from the
buffer in which you are currently to a named buffer.  It happens that
<code>insert-buffer-substring</code> does just the reverse&mdash;it copies text
from another buffer to the current buffer&mdash;that is why the
<code>append-to-buffer</code> definition starts out with a <code>let</code> that
binds the local symbol <code>oldbuf</code> to the value returned by
<code>current-buffer</code>.

   <p>The <code>insert-buffer-substring</code> expression looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (insert-buffer-substring oldbuf start end)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <code>insert-buffer-substring</code> function copies a string
<em>from</em> the buffer specified as its first argument and inserts the
string into the present buffer.  In this case, the argument to
<code>insert-buffer-substring</code> is the value of the variable created
and bound by the <code>let</code>, namely the value of <code>oldbuf</code>, which
was the current buffer when you gave the <code>append-to-buffer</code>
command.

   <p>After <code>insert-buffer-substring</code> has done its work,
<code>save-excursion</code> will restore the action to the original buffer
and <code>append-to-buffer</code> will have done its job.

   <p>Written in skeletal form, the workings of the body look like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (let (<var>bind-</var><code>oldbuf</code><var>-to-value-of-</var><code>current-buffer</code>)
       (save-excursion                       ; <span class="roman">Keep track of buffer.</span>
         <var>change-buffer</var>
         <var>insert-substring-from-</var><code>oldbuf</code><var>-into-buffer</var>)
     
       <var>change-back-to-original-buffer-when-finished</var>
     <var>let-the-local-meaning-of-</var><code>oldbuf</code><var>-disappear-when-finished</var>
</pre>
   <p>In summary, <code>append-to-buffer</code> works as follows: it saves the
value of the current buffer in the variable called <code>oldbuf</code>.  It
gets the new buffer (creating one if need be) and switches Emacs's
attention to it.  Using the value of <code>oldbuf</code>, it inserts the
region of text from the old buffer into the new buffer; and then using
<code>save-excursion</code>, it brings you back to your original buffer.

   <p>In looking at <code>append-to-buffer</code>, you have explored a fairly
complex function.  It shows how to use <code>let</code> and
<code>save-excursion</code>, and how to change to and come back from another
buffer.  Many function definitions use <code>let</code>,
<code>save-excursion</code>, and <code>set-buffer</code> this way.
