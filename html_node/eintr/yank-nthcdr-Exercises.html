<h3 class="section">10.3 Exercises with <code>yank</code> and <code>nthcdr</code></h3>

     <ul>
<li>Using <kbd>C-h v</kbd> (<code>describe-variable</code>), look at the value of
your kill ring.  Add several items to your kill ring; look at its
value again.  Using <kbd>M-y</kbd> (<code>yank-pop)</code>, move all the way
around the kill ring.  How many items were in your kill ring?  Find
the value of <code>kill-ring-max</code>.  Was your kill ring full, or could
you have kept more blocks of text within it?

     <li>Using <code>nthcdr</code> and <code>car</code>, construct a series of expressions
to return the first, second, third, and fourth elements of a list. 
</ul>
