<h3 class="section">3.4 Different Options for <code>interactive</code></h3>

<p><a name="index-Options-for-_0040code_007binteractive_007d-108"></a><a name="index-Interactive-options-109"></a>
In the example, <code>multiply-by-seven</code> used <code>"p"</code> as the
argument to <code>interactive</code>.  This argument told Emacs to interpret
your typing either <kbd>C-u</kbd> followed by a number or &lt;META&gt;
followed by a number as a command to pass that number to the function
as its argument.  Emacs has more than twenty characters predefined for
use with <code>interactive</code>.  In almost every case, one of these
options will enable you to pass the right information interactively to
a function.  (See <a href="../elisp/Interactive-Codes.html#Interactive-Codes">Code Characters for <code>interactive</code></a>.)

   <p>Consider the function <code>zap-to-char</code>.  Its interactive expression
is

<!-- FIXME: the interactive expression of zap-to-char has been changed -->
<!-- (in 2012-04-10). -->
<pre class="smallexample">     (interactive "p\ncZap to char: ")
</pre>
   <p>The first part of the argument to <code>interactive</code> is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo;, with
which you are already familiar.  This argument tells Emacs to
interpret a prefix, as a number to be passed to the function.  You
can specify a prefix either by typing <kbd>C-u</kbd> followed by a number
or by typing &lt;META&gt; followed by a number.  The prefix is the
number of specified characters.  Thus, if your prefix is three and the
specified character is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;, then you will delete all the text up
to and including the third next &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If you do not set a prefix,
then you delete all the text up to and including the specified
character, but no more.

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo; tells the function the name of the character to which to delete.

   <p>More formally, a function with two or more arguments can have
information passed to each argument by adding parts to the string that
follows <code>interactive</code>.  When you do this, the information is
passed to each argument in the same order it is specified in the
<code>interactive</code> list.  In the string, each part is separated from
the next part by a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\n</span></samp>&rsquo;, which is a newline.  For example, you
can follow &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo; with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\n</span></samp>&rsquo; and an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cZap to char: </span></samp>&rsquo;. 
This causes Emacs to pass the value of the prefix argument (if there
is one) and the character.

   <p>In this case, the function definition looks like the following, where
<code>arg</code> and <code>char</code> are the symbols to which <code>interactive</code>
binds the prefix argument and the specified character:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defun <var>name-of-function</var> (arg char)
       "<var>documentation</var>..."
       (interactive "p\ncZap to char: ")
       <var>body-of-function</var>...)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(The space after the colon in the prompt makes it look better when you
are prompted.  See <a href="copy_002dto_002dbuffer.html#copy_002dto_002dbuffer">The Definition of <code>copy-to-buffer</code></a>, for an example.)

   <p>When a function does not take arguments, <code>interactive</code> does not
require any.  Such a function contains the simple expression
<code>(interactive)</code>.  The <code>mark-whole-buffer</code> function is like
this.

   <p>Alternatively, if the special letter-codes are not right for your
application, you can pass your own arguments to <code>interactive</code> as
a list.

   <p>See <a href="append_002dto_002dbuffer.html#append_002dto_002dbuffer">The Definition of <code>append-to-buffer</code></a>,
for an example.  See <a href="../elisp/Using-Interactive.html#Using-Interactive">Using <code>Interactive</code></a>, for a more complete
explanation about this technique.
