<h3 class="section">14.2 What Constitutes a Word or Symbol?</h3>

<p><a name="index-Syntax-categories-and-tables-281"></a>
Emacs treats different characters as belonging to different
<dfn>syntax categories</dfn>.  For example, the regular expression,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\w+</span></samp>&rsquo;, is a pattern specifying one or more <em>word
constituent</em> characters.  Word constituent characters are members of
one syntax category.  Other syntax categories include the class of
punctuation characters, such as the period and the comma, and the
class of whitespace characters, such as the blank space and the tab
character.  (For more information, see <a href="../elisp/Syntax-Tables.html#Syntax-Tables">Syntax Tables</a>.)

   <p>Syntax tables specify which characters belong to which categories. 
Usually, a hyphen is not specified as a word constituent character. 
Instead, it is specified as being in the class of characters that are
part of symbol names but not words.  This means that the
<code>count-words-example</code> function treats it in the same way it treats
an interword white space, which is why <code>count-words-example</code>
counts &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">multiply-by-seven</span></samp>&rsquo; as three words.

   <p>There are two ways to cause Emacs to count &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">multiply-by-seven</span></samp>&rsquo; as
one symbol: modify the syntax table or modify the regular expression.

   <p>We could redefine a hyphen as a word constituent character by
modifying the syntax table that Emacs keeps for each mode.  This
action would serve our purpose, except that a hyphen is merely the
most common character within symbols that is not typically a word
constituent character; there are others, too.

   <p>Alternatively, we can redefine the regexp used in the
<code>count-words-example</code> definition so as to include symbols.  This
procedure has the merit of clarity, but the task is a little tricky.

   <p>The first part is simple enough: the pattern must match at least one
character that is a word or symbol constituent.  Thus:

<pre class="smallexample">     "\\(\\w\\|\\s_\\)+"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\(</span></samp>&rsquo; is the first part of the grouping construct that
includes the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\w</span></samp>&rsquo; and the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\s_</span></samp>&rsquo; as alternatives, separated
by the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\|</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\w</span></samp>&rsquo; matches any word-constituent
character and the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\s_</span></samp>&rsquo; matches any character that is part of a
symbol name but not a word-constituent character.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;
following the group indicates that the word or symbol constituent
characters must be matched at least once.

   <p>However, the second part of the regexp is more difficult to design. 
What we want is to follow the first part with optionally one or more
characters that are not constituents of a word or symbol.  At first,
I thought I could define this with the following:

<pre class="smallexample">     "\\(\\W\\|\\S_\\)*"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The upper case &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">W</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">S</span></samp>&rsquo; match characters that are
<em>not</em> word or symbol constituents.  Unfortunately, this
expression matches any character that is either not a word constituent
or not a symbol constituent.  This matches any character!

   <p>I then noticed that every word or symbol in my test region was
followed by white space (blank space, tab, or newline).  So I tried
placing a pattern to match one or more blank spaces after the pattern
for one or more word or symbol constituents.  This failed, too.  Words
and symbols are often separated by whitespace, but in actual code
parentheses may follow symbols and punctuation may follow words.  So
finally, I designed a pattern in which the word or symbol constituents
are followed optionally by characters that are not white space and
then followed optionally by white space.

   <p>Here is the full regular expression:

<pre class="smallexample">     "\\(\\w\\|\\s_\\)+[^ \t\n]*[ \t\n]*"
</pre>
   </body></html>
