<h3 class="section">16.14 A Modified Mode Line</h3>

<p><a name="index-mode_002dline_002dformat-348"></a><a name="index-Mode-line-format-349"></a>
Finally, a feature I really like: a modified mode line.

   <p>When I work over a network, I forget which machine I am using.  Also,
I tend to I lose track of where I am, and which line point is on.

   <p>So I reset my mode line to look like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     -:-- foo.texi   rattlesnake:/home/bob/  Line 1  (Texinfo Fill) Top
</pre>
   <p>I am visiting a file called <samp><span class="file">foo.texi</span></samp>, on my machine
<samp><span class="file">rattlesnake</span></samp> in my <samp><span class="file">/home/bob</span></samp> buffer.  I am on line 1, in
Texinfo mode, and am at the top of the buffer.

   <p>My <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file has a section that looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     ;; Set a Mode Line that tells me which machine, which directory,
     ;; and which line I am on, plus the other customary information.
     (setq-default mode-line-format
      (quote
       (#("-" 0 1
          (help-echo
           "mouse-1: select window, mouse-2: delete others ..."))
        mode-line-mule-info
        mode-line-modified
        mode-line-frame-identification
        "    "
        mode-line-buffer-identification
        "    "
        (:eval (substring
                (system-name) 0 (string-match "\\..+" (system-name))))
        ":"
        default-directory
        #(" " 0 1
          (help-echo
           "mouse-1: select window, mouse-2: delete others ..."))
        (line-number-mode " Line %l ")
        global-mode-string
        #("   %[(" 0 6
          (help-echo
           "mouse-1: select window, mouse-2: delete others ..."))
        (:eval (mode-line-mode-name))
        mode-line-process
        minor-mode-alist
        #("%n" 0 2 (help-echo "mouse-2: widen" local-map (keymap ...)))
        ")%] "
        (-3 . "%P")
        ;;   "-%-"
        )))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here, I redefine the default mode line.  Most of the parts are from
the original; but I make a few changes.  I set the <em>default</em> mode
line format so as to permit various modes, such as Info, to override
it.

   <p>Many elements in the list are self-explanatory:
<code>mode-line-modified</code> is a variable that tells whether the buffer
has been modified, <code>mode-name</code> tells the name of the mode, and so
on.  However, the format looks complicated because of two features we
have not discussed.

   <p><a name="index-Properties_002c-in-mode-line-example-350"></a>The first string in the mode line is a dash or hyphen, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In
the old days, it would have been specified simply as <code>"-"</code>.  But
nowadays, Emacs can add properties to a string, such as highlighting
or, as in this case, a help feature.  If you place your mouse cursor
over the hyphen, some help information appears (By default, you must
wait seven-tenths of a second before the information appears.  You can
change that timing by changing the value of <code>tooltip-delay</code>.)

   <p>The new string format has a special syntax:

<pre class="smallexample">     #("-" 0 1 (help-echo "mouse-1: select window, ..."))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <code>#(</code> begins a list.  The first element of the list is the
string itself, just one &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The second and third
elements specify the range over which the fourth element applies.  A
range starts <em>after</em> a character, so a zero means the range
starts just before the first character; a 1 means that the range ends
just after the first character.  The third element is the property for
the range.  It consists of a property list,  a
property name, in this case, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">help-echo</span></samp>&rsquo;, followed by a value, in this
case, a string.  The second, third, and fourth elements of this new
string format can be repeated.

   <p>See <a href="../elisp/Text-Properties.html#Text-Properties">Text Properties</a>, and see <a href="../elisp/Mode-Line-Format.html#Mode-Line-Format">Mode Line Format</a>, for more information.

   <p><code>mode-line-buffer-identification</code>
displays the current buffer name.  It is a list
beginning <code>(#("%12b" 0 4 ...</code>. 
The <code>#(</code> begins the list.

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"%12b"</span></samp>&rsquo; displays the current buffer name, using the
<code>buffer-name</code> function with which we are familiar; the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">12</span></samp>&rsquo;
specifies the maximum number of characters that will be displayed. 
When a name has fewer characters, whitespace is added to fill out to
this number.  (Buffer names can and often should be longer than 12
characters; this length works well in a typical 80 column wide
window.)

   <p><code>:eval</code> says to evaluate the following form and use the result as
a string to display.  In this case, the expression displays the first
component of the full system name.  The end of the first component is
a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; (period), so I use the <code>string-match</code> function to
tell me the length of the first component.  The substring from the
zeroth character to that length is the name of the machine.

   <p>This is the expression:

<pre class="smallexample">     (:eval (substring
             (system-name) 0 (string-match "\\..+" (system-name))))
</pre>
   <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%[</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%]</span></samp>&rsquo; cause a pair of square brackets
to appear for each recursive editing level.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%n</span></samp>&rsquo; says &ldquo;Narrow&rdquo;
when narrowing is in effect.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%P</span></samp>&rsquo; tells you the percentage of
the buffer that is above the bottom of the window, or &ldquo;Top&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bottom&rdquo;,
or &ldquo;All&rdquo;.  (A lower case &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo; tell you the percentage above the
<em>top</em> of the window.)  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%-</span></samp>&rsquo; inserts enough dashes to fill
out the line.

   <p>Remember, you don't have to like Emacs to like it&mdash;your own
Emacs can have different colors, different commands, and different
keys than a default Emacs.

   <p>On the other hand, if you want to bring up a plain out-of-the-box
Emacs, with no customization, type:

<pre class="smallexample">     emacs -q
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This will start an Emacs that does <em>not</em> load your
<samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> initialization file.  A plain, default Emacs.  Nothing
more.
