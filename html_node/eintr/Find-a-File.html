<h3 class="section">14.5 Find a File</h3>

<p><a name="index-Find-a-File-284"></a>
To find a file in Emacs, you use the <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> (<code>find-file</code>)
command.  This command is almost, but not quite right for the lengths
problem.

   <p>Let's look at the source for <code>find-file</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defun find-file (filename)
       "Edit file FILENAME.
     Switch to a buffer visiting file FILENAME,
     creating one if none already exists."
       (interactive "FFind file: ")
       (switch-to-buffer (find-file-noselect filename)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(The most recent version of the <code>find-file</code> function definition
permits you to specify optional wildcards to visit multiple files;
that makes the definition more complex and we will not discuss it
here, since it is not relevant.  You can see its source using either
<kbd>M-.</kbd> (<code>xref-find-definitions</code>) or <kbd>C-h f</kbd>
(<code>describe-function</code>).)

   <p>The definition I am showing possesses short but complete documentation
and an interactive specification that prompts you for a file name when
you use the command interactively.  The body of the definition
contains two functions, <code>find-file-noselect</code> and
<code>switch-to-buffer</code>.

   <p>According to its documentation as shown by <kbd>C-h f</kbd> (the
<code>describe-function</code> command), the <code>find-file-noselect</code>
function reads the named file into a buffer and returns the buffer. 
(Its most recent version includes an optional <var>wildcards</var> argument,
too, as well as another to read a file literally and another to
suppress warning messages.  These optional arguments are irrelevant.)

   <p>However, the <code>find-file-noselect</code> function does not select the
buffer in which it puts the file.  Emacs does not switch its attention
(or yours if you are using <code>find-file-noselect</code>) to the selected
buffer.  That is what <code>switch-to-buffer</code> does: it switches the
buffer to which Emacs attention is directed; and it switches the
buffer displayed in the window to the new buffer.  We have discussed
buffer switching elsewhere.  (See <a href="Switching-Buffers.html#Switching-Buffers">Switching Buffers</a>.)

   <p>In this histogram project, we do not need to display each file on the
screen as the program determines the length of each definition within
it.  Instead of employing <code>switch-to-buffer</code>, we can work with
<code>set-buffer</code>, which redirects the attention of the computer
program to a different buffer but does not redisplay it on the screen. 
So instead of calling on <code>find-file</code> to do the job, we must write
our own expression.

   <p>The task is easy: use <code>find-file-noselect</code> and <code>set-buffer</code>.
