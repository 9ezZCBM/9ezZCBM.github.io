<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Seeing the Current Value of a Variable</h4>

   <p>You can see the current value of a variable, any variable, by using
the <code>describe-variable</code> function, which is usually invoked by
typing <kbd>C-h v</kbd>.  If you type <kbd>C-h v</kbd> and then <code>kill-ring</code>
(followed by &lt;RET&gt;) when prompted, you will see what is in your
current kill ring&mdash;this may be quite a lot!  Conversely, if you have
been doing nothing this Emacs session except read this document, you
may have nothing in it.  Also, you will see the documentation for
<code>kill-ring</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     Documentation:
     List of killed text sequences.
     Since the kill ring is supposed to interact nicely with cut-and-paste
     facilities offered by window systems, use of this variable should
     interact nicely with `interprogram-cut-function' and
     `interprogram-paste-function'.  The functions `kill-new',
     `kill-append', and `current-kill' are supposed to implement this
     interaction; you may want to use them instead of manipulating the kill
     ring directly.
</pre>
   <p>The kill ring is defined by a <code>defvar</code> in the following way:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defvar kill-ring nil
       "List of killed text sequences.
     ...")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this variable definition, the variable is given an initial value of
<code>nil</code>, which makes sense, since if you have saved nothing, you want
nothing back if you give a <code>yank</code> command.  The documentation
string is written just like the documentation string of a <code>defun</code>. 
As with the documentation string of the <code>defun</code>, the first line of
the documentation should be a complete sentence, since some commands,
like <code>apropos</code>, print only the first line of documentation. 
Succeeding lines should not be indented; otherwise they look odd when
you use <kbd>C-h v</kbd> (<code>describe-variable</code>).
