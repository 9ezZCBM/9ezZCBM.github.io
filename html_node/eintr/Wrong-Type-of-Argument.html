<h4 class="subsection">1.8.4 Using the Wrong Type Object as an Argument</h4>

<p><a name="index-Wrong-type-of-argument-57"></a><a name="index-Argument_002c-wrong-type-of-58"></a>
When a function is passed an argument of the wrong type, the Lisp
interpreter produces an error message.  For example, the <code>+</code>
function expects the values of its arguments to be numbers.  As an
experiment we can pass it the quoted symbol <code>hello</code> instead of a
number.  Position the cursor after the following expression and type
<kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>:

<pre class="smallexample">     (+ 2 'hello)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When you do this you will generate an error message.  What has happened
is that <code>+</code> has tried to add the 2 to the value returned by
<code>'hello</code>, but the value returned by <code>'hello</code> is the symbol
<code>hello</code>, not a number.  Only numbers can be added.  So <code>+</code>
could not carry out its addition.

   <p>You will create and enter a <samp><span class="file">*Backtrace*</span></samp> buffer that says:

<p class="noindent">
<pre class="smallexample">     ---------- Buffer: *Backtrace* ----------
     Debugger entered--Lisp error:
              (wrong-type-argument number-or-marker-p hello)
       +(2 hello)
       eval((+ 2 'hello) nil)
       elisp--eval-last-sexp(t)
       eval-last-sexp(nil)
       funcall-interactively(eval-print-last-sexp nil)
       call-interactively(eval-print-last-sexp nil nil)
       command-execute(eval-print-last-sexp)
     ---------- Buffer: *Backtrace* ----------
</pre>
   <p>As usual, the error message tries to be helpful and makes sense after you
learn how to read it.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

   <p>The first part of the error message is straightforward; it says
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">wrong type argument</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Next comes the mysterious jargon word
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">number-or-marker-p</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->.  This word is trying to tell you what
kind of argument the <code>+</code> expected.

   <p>The symbol <code>number-or-marker-p</code> says that the Lisp interpreter is
trying to determine whether the information presented it (the value of
the argument) is a number or a marker (a special object representing a
buffer position).  What it does is test to see whether the <code>+</code> is
being given numbers to add.  It also tests to see whether the
argument is something called a marker, which is a specific feature of
Emacs Lisp.  (In Emacs, locations in a buffer are recorded as markers. 
When the mark is set with the <kbd>C-@</kbd> or <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> command,
its position is kept as a marker.  The mark can be considered a
number&mdash;the number of characters the location is from the beginning
of the buffer.)  In Emacs Lisp, <code>+</code> can be used to add the
numeric value of marker positions as numbers.

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo; of <code>number-or-marker-p</code> is the embodiment of a
practice started in the early days of Lisp programming.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo;
stands for &ldquo;predicate&rdquo;.  In the jargon used by the early Lisp
researchers, a predicate refers to a function to determine whether some
property is true or false.  So the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo; tells us that
<code>number-or-marker-p</code> is the name of a function that determines
whether it is true or false that the argument supplied is a number or
a marker.  Other Lisp symbols that end in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo; include <code>zerop</code>,
a function that tests whether its argument has the value of zero, and
<code>listp</code>, a function that tests whether its argument is a list.

   <p>Finally, the last part of the error message is the symbol <code>hello</code>. 
This is the value of the argument that was passed to <code>+</code>.  If the
addition had been passed the correct type of object, the value passed
would have been a number, such as 37, rather than a symbol like
<code>hello</code>.  But then you would not have got the error message.
