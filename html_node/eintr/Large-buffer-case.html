<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">What happens in a large buffer</h5>

<p>In <code>beginning-of-buffer</code>, the inner <code>if</code> expression tests
whether the size of the buffer is greater than 10,000 characters.  To do
this, it uses the <code>&gt;</code> function and the computation of <code>size</code>
that comes from the let expression.

   <p>In the old days, the function <code>buffer-size</code> was used.  Not only
was that function called several times, it gave the size of the whole
buffer, not the accessible part.  The computation makes much more
sense when it handles just the accessible part.  (See <a href="Narrowing-_0026-Widening.html#Narrowing-_0026-Widening">Narrowing and Widening</a>, for more information on focusing
attention to an accessible part.)

   <p>The line looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (if (&gt; size 10000)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When the buffer is large, the then-part of the <code>if</code> expression is
evaluated.  It reads like this (after formatting for easy reading):

<pre class="smallexample">     (*
       (prefix-numeric-value arg)
       (/ size 10))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This expression is a multiplication, with two arguments to the function
<code>*</code>.

   <p>The first argument is <code>(prefix-numeric-value arg)</code>.  When
<code>"P"</code> is used as the argument for <code>interactive</code>, the value
passed to the function as its argument is passed a <dfn>raw prefix
argument</dfn>, and not a number.  (It is a number in a list.)  To perform
the arithmetic, a conversion is necessary, and
<code>prefix-numeric-value</code> does the job.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_002f-_0040r_007b_0028division_0029_007d-165"></a><a name="index-Division-166"></a>The second argument is <code>(/ size 10)</code>.  This expression divides
the numeric value by ten&mdash;the numeric value of the size of the
accessible portion of the buffer.  This produces a number that tells
how many characters make up one tenth of the buffer size.  (In Lisp,
<code>/</code> is used for division, just as <code>*</code> is used for
multiplication.)

   <p>In the multiplication expression as a whole, this amount is multiplied
by the value of the prefix argument&mdash;the multiplication looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (* <var>numeric-value-of-prefix-arg</var>
        <var>number-of-characters-in-one-tenth-of-the-accessible-buffer</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If, for example, the prefix argument is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">7</span></samp>&rsquo;, the one-tenth value
will be multiplied by 7 to give a position 70% of the way through.

   <p>The result of all this is that if the accessible portion of the buffer
is large, the <code>goto-char</code> expression reads like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (goto-char (* (prefix-numeric-value arg)
                   (/ size 10)))
</pre>
   <p>This puts the cursor where we want it.
