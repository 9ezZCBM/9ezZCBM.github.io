<h3 class="section">16.4 Text and Auto Fill Mode</h3>

<p>Now we come to the part that turns on Text mode and
Auto Fill mode.

<pre class="smallexample">     ;;; Text mode and Auto Fill mode
     ;; The next two lines put Emacs into Text mode
     ;; and Auto Fill mode, and are for writers who
     ;; want to start writing prose rather than code.
     (setq-default major-mode 'text-mode)
     (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
</pre>
   <p>Here is the first part of this <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file that does something
besides remind a forgetful human!

   <p>The first of the two lines in parentheses tells Emacs to turn on Text
mode when you find a file, <em>unless</em> that file should go into some
other mode, such as C mode.

   <p><a name="index-Per_002dbuffer_002c-local-variables-list-314"></a><a name="index-Local-variables-list_002c-per_002dbuffer_002c-315"></a><a name="index-Automatic-mode-selection-316"></a><a name="index-Mode-selection_002c-automatic-317"></a>When Emacs reads a file, it looks at the extension to the file name,
if any.  (The extension is the part that comes after a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;.)  If
the file ends with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.c</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.h</span></samp>&rsquo; extension then Emacs turns
on C mode.  Also, Emacs looks at first nonblank line of the file; if
the line says &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-*-&nbsp;C&nbsp;-*-</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->, Emacs turns on C mode.  Emacs
possesses a list of extensions and specifications that it uses
automatically.  In addition, Emacs looks near the last page for a
per-buffer, local variables list, if any.

   <p>Now, back to the <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.

   <p>Here is the line again; how does it work?

   <p><a name="index-Text-Mode-turned-on-318"></a>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq major-mode 'text-mode)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This line is a short, but complete Emacs Lisp expression.

   <p>We are already familiar with <code>setq</code>.  It sets the following variable,
<code>major-mode</code>, to the subsequent value, which is <code>text-mode</code>. 
The single-quote before <code>text-mode</code> tells Emacs to deal directly
with the <code>text-mode</code> symbol, not with whatever it might stand for. 
See <a href="set-_0026-setq.html#set-_0026-setq">Setting the Value of a Variable</a>,
for a reminder of how <code>setq</code> works. 
The main point is that there is no difference between the procedure you
use to set a value in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file and the procedure you use
anywhere else in Emacs.

   <p>Here is the next line:

   <p><a name="index-Auto-Fill-mode-turned-on-319"></a><a name="index-add_002dhook-320"></a>
<pre class="smallexample">     (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this line, the <code>add-hook</code> command adds
<code>turn-on-auto-fill</code> to the variable.

   <p><code>turn-on-auto-fill</code> is the name of a program, that, you guessed
it!, turns on Auto Fill mode.

   <p>Every time Emacs turns on Text mode, Emacs runs the commands hooked
onto Text mode.  So every time Emacs turns on Text mode, Emacs also
turns on Auto Fill mode.

   <p>In brief, the first line causes Emacs to enter Text mode when you edit a
file, unless the file name extension, a first non-blank line, or local
variables to tell Emacs otherwise.

   <p>Text mode among other actions, sets the syntax table to work
conveniently for writers.  In Text mode, Emacs considers an apostrophe
as part of a word like a letter; but Emacs does not consider a period
or a space as part of a word.  Thus, <kbd>M-f</kbd> moves you over
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">it's</span></samp>&rsquo;.  On the other hand, in C mode, <kbd>M-f</kbd> stops just after
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>&rsquo; of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">it's</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The second line causes Emacs to turn on Auto Fill mode when it turns
on Text mode.  In Auto Fill mode, Emacs automatically breaks a line
that is too wide and brings the excessively wide part of the line down
to the next line.  Emacs breaks lines between words, not within them.

   <p>When Auto Fill mode is turned off, lines continue to the right as you
type them.  Depending on how you set the value of
<code>truncate-lines</code>, the words you type either disappear off the
right side of the screen, or else are shown, in a rather ugly and
unreadable manner, as a continuation line on the screen.

   <p>In addition, in this part of my <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file, I tell the Emacs
fill commands to insert two spaces after a colon:

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq colon-double-space t)
</pre>
   </body></html>
