<h4 class="subsection">11.1.2 An Example: <code>print-elements-of-list</code></h4>

<p><a name="index-print_002delements_002dof_002dlist-230"></a>
The <code>print-elements-of-list</code> function illustrates a <code>while</code>
loop with a list.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007b_002ascratch_002a_007d-buffer-231"></a>The function requires several lines for its output.  If you are
reading this in a recent instance of GNU Emacs,
<!-- GNU Emacs 21, GNU Emacs 22, or a later version, -->
you can evaluate the following expression inside of Info, as usual.

   <p>If you are using an earlier version of Emacs, you need to copy the
necessary expressions to your <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer and evaluate
them there.  This is because the echo area had only one line in the
earlier versions.

   <p>You can copy the expressions by marking the beginning of the region
with <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> (<code>set-mark-command</code>), moving the cursor to
the end of the region and then copying the region using <kbd>M-w</kbd>
(<code>kill-ring-save</code>, which calls <code>copy-region-as-kill</code> and
then provides visual feedback).  In the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp>
buffer, you can yank the expressions back by typing <kbd>C-y</kbd>
(<code>yank</code>).

   <p>After you have copied the expressions to the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer,
evaluate each expression in turn.  Be sure to evaluate the last
expression, <code>(print-elements-of-list animals)</code>, by typing
<kbd>C-u C-x C-e</kbd>, that is, by giving an argument to
<code>eval-last-sexp</code>.  This will cause the result of the evaluation
to be printed in the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer instead of being printed
in the echo area.  (Otherwise you will see something like this in your
echo area: <code>^Jgazelle^J^Jgiraffe^J^Jlion^J^Jtiger^Jnil</code>, in which
each &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^J</span></samp>&rsquo; stands for a newline.)

   <p>In a recent instance of GNU Emacs, you can evaluate these expressions
directly in the Info buffer, and the echo area will grow to show the
results.

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq animals '(gazelle giraffe lion tiger))
     
     (defun print-elements-of-list (list)
       "Print each element of LIST on a line of its own."
       (while list
         (print (car list))
         (setq list (cdr list))))
     
     (print-elements-of-list animals)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When you evaluate the three expressions in sequence, you will see
this:

<pre class="smallexample">     gazelle
     
     giraffe
     
     lion
     
     tiger
     nil
</pre>
   <p>Each element of the list is printed on a line of its own (that is what
the function <code>print</code> does) and then the value returned by the
function is printed.  Since the last expression in the function is the
<code>while</code> loop, and since <code>while</code> loops always return
<code>nil</code>, a <code>nil</code> is printed after the last element of the list.
