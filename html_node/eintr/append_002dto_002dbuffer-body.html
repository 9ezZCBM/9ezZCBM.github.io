<h4 class="subsection">4.4.2 The Body of <code>append-to-buffer</code></h4>

<p>The body of the <code>append-to-buffer</code> function begins with <code>let</code>.

   <p>As we have seen before (see <a href="let.html#let"><code>let</code></a>), the purpose of a
<code>let</code> expression is to create and give initial values to one or
more variables that will only be used within the body of the
<code>let</code>.  This means that such a variable will not be confused with
any variable of the same name outside the <code>let</code> expression.

   <p>We can see how the <code>let</code> expression fits into the function as a
whole by showing a template for <code>append-to-buffer</code> with the
<code>let</code> expression in outline:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defun append-to-buffer (buffer start end)
       "<var>documentation</var>..."
       (interactive ...)
       (let ((<var>variable</var> <var>value</var>))
             <var>body</var>...)
</pre>
   <p>The <code>let</code> expression has three elements:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The symbol <code>let</code>;

     <li>A varlist containing, in this case, a single two-element list,
<code>(</code><var>variable</var> <var>value</var><code>)</code>;

     <li>The body of the <code>let</code> expression.
        </ol>

   <p>In the <code>append-to-buffer</code> function, the varlist looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (oldbuf (current-buffer))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this part of the <code>let</code> expression, the one variable,
<code>oldbuf</code>, is bound to the value returned by the
<code>(current-buffer)</code> expression.  The variable, <code>oldbuf</code>, is
used to keep track of the buffer in which you are working and from
which you will copy.

   <p>The element or elements of a varlist are surrounded by a set of
parentheses so the Lisp interpreter can distinguish the varlist from
the body of the <code>let</code>.  As a consequence, the two-element list
within the varlist is surrounded by a circumscribing set of parentheses. 
The line looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (let ((oldbuf (current-buffer)))
       ... )
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The two parentheses before <code>oldbuf</code> might surprise you if you did
not realize that the first parenthesis before <code>oldbuf</code> marks the
boundary of the varlist and the second parenthesis marks the beginning
of the two-element list, <code>(oldbuf (current-buffer))</code>.
