<h3 class="section">11.4 Looping Exercise</h3>

     <ul>
<li>Write a function similar to <code>triangle</code> in which each row has a
value which is the square of the row number.  Use a <code>while</code> loop.

     <li>Write a function similar to <code>triangle</code> that multiplies instead of
adds the values.

     <li>Rewrite these two functions recursively.  Rewrite these functions
using <code>cond</code>.

     <!-- comma in printed title causes problem in Info cross reference -->
     <li>Write a function for Texinfo mode that creates an index entry at the
beginning of a paragraph for every &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@dfn</span></samp>&rsquo; within the paragraph. 
(In a Texinfo file, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@dfn</span></samp>&rsquo; marks a definition.  This book is
written in Texinfo.)

     <p>Many of the functions you will need are described in two of the
previous chapters, <a href="Cutting-_0026-Storing-Text.html#Cutting-_0026-Storing-Text">Cutting and Storing Text</a>, and <a href="Yanking.html#Yanking">Yanking Text Back</a>.  If you use
<code>forward-paragraph</code> to put the index entry at the beginning of
the paragraph, you will have to use <kbd>C-h&nbsp;f</kbd><!-- /@w -->
(<code>describe-function</code>) to find out how to make the command go
backwards.

     <p>For more information, see
<a href="../texinfo/Indicating.html#Indicating">Indicating</a>, which goes to
a Texinfo manual in the current directory.  Or, if you are on the
Internet, see
