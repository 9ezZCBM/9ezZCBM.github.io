<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">The parts of the function definition</h5>

<p>We start with three variables: the total number of rows in the
triangle; the number of pebbles in a row; and the total number of
pebbles, which is what we want to calculate.  These variables can be
named <code>number-of-rows</code>, <code>number-of-pebbles-in-row</code>, and
<code>total</code>, respectively.

   <p>Both <code>total</code> and <code>number-of-pebbles-in-row</code> are used only
inside the function and are declared with <code>let</code>.  The initial
value of <code>total</code> should, of course, be zero.  However, the
initial value of <code>number-of-pebbles-in-row</code> should be equal to
the number of rows in the triangle, since the addition will start with
the longest row.

   <p>This means that the beginning of the <code>let</code> expression will look
like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (let ((total 0)
           (number-of-pebbles-in-row number-of-rows))
       <var>body</var>...)
</pre>
   <p>The total number of pebbles can be found by repeatedly adding the number
of pebbles in a row to the total already found, that is, by repeatedly
evaluating the following expression:

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq total (+ total number-of-pebbles-in-row))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">After the <code>number-of-pebbles-in-row</code> is added to the <code>total</code>,
the <code>number-of-pebbles-in-row</code> should be decremented by one, since
the next time the loop repeats, the preceding row will be
added to the total.

   <p>The number of pebbles in a preceding row is one less than the number of
pebbles in a row, so the built-in Emacs Lisp function <code>1-</code> can be
used to compute the number of pebbles in the preceding row.  This can be
done with the following expression:

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq number-of-pebbles-in-row
           (1- number-of-pebbles-in-row))
</pre>
   <p>Finally, we know that the <code>while</code> loop should stop making repeated
additions when there are no pebbles in a row.  So the test for
the <code>while</code> loop is simply:

<pre class="smallexample">     (while (&gt; number-of-pebbles-in-row 0)
</pre>
