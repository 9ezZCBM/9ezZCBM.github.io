<h3 class="section">7.3 <code>nthcdr</code></h3>

<p><a name="index-nthcdr-178"></a>
The <code>nthcdr</code> function is associated with the <code>cdr</code> function. 
What it does is take the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of a list repeatedly.

   <p>If you take the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the list <code>(pine fir
oak maple)</code>, you will be returned the list <code>(fir oak maple)</code>.  If you
repeat this on what was returned, you will be returned the list
<code>(oak maple)</code>.  (Of course, repeated <span class="sc">cdr</span>ing on the original
list will just give you the original <span class="sc">cdr</span> since the function does
not change the list.  You need to evaluate the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the
<span class="sc">cdr</span> and so on.)  If you continue this, eventually you will be
returned an empty list, which in this case, instead of being shown as
<code>()</code> is shown as <code>nil</code>.

   <p>For review, here is a series of repeated <span class="sc">cdr</span>s, the text following
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&rArr;</span></samp>&rsquo; shows what is returned.

<pre class="smallexample">     (cdr '(pine fir oak maple))
          &rArr;(fir oak maple)
     
     (cdr '(fir oak maple))
          &rArr; (oak maple)
     
     (cdr '(oak maple))
          &rArr;(maple)
     
     (cdr '(maple))
          &rArr; nil
     
     (cdr 'nil)
          &rArr; nil
     
     (cdr ())
          &rArr; nil
</pre>
   <p>You can also do several <span class="sc">cdr</span>s without printing the values in
between, like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (cdr (cdr '(pine fir oak maple)))
          &rArr; (oak maple)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this example, the Lisp interpreter evaluates the innermost list first. 
The innermost list is quoted, so it just passes the list as it is to the
innermost <code>cdr</code>.  This <code>cdr</code> passes a list made up of the
second and subsequent elements of the list to the outermost <code>cdr</code>,
which produces a list composed of the third and subsequent elements of
the original list.  In this example, the <code>cdr</code> function is repeated
and returns a list that consists of the original list without its
first two elements.

   <p>The <code>nthcdr</code> function does the same as repeating the call to
<code>cdr</code>.  In the following example, the argument 2 is passed to the
function <code>nthcdr</code>, along with the list, and the value returned is
the list without its first two items, which is exactly the same
as repeating <code>cdr</code> twice on the list:

<pre class="smallexample">     (nthcdr 2 '(pine fir oak maple))
          &rArr; (oak maple)
</pre>
   <p>Using the original four element list, we can see what happens when
various numeric arguments are passed to <code>nthcdr</code>, including 0, 1,
and 5:

<pre class="smallexample">     ;; <span class="roman">Leave the list as it was.</span>
     (nthcdr 0 '(pine fir oak maple))
          &rArr; (pine fir oak maple)
     
     ;; <span class="roman">Return a copy without the first element.</span>
     (nthcdr 1 '(pine fir oak maple))
          &rArr; (fir oak maple)
     
     ;; <span class="roman">Return a copy of the list without three elements.</span>
     (nthcdr 3 '(pine fir oak maple))
          &rArr; (maple)
     
     ;; <span class="roman">Return a copy lacking all four elements.</span>
     (nthcdr 4 '(pine fir oak maple))
          &rArr; nil
     
     ;; <span class="roman">Return a copy lacking all elements.</span>
     (nthcdr 5 '(pine fir oak maple))
          &rArr; nil
</pre>
   </body></html>
