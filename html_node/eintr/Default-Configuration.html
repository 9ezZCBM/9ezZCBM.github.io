<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Emacs's Default Configuration</h3>

   <p>There are those who appreciate Emacs's default configuration.  After
all, Emacs starts you in C mode when you edit a C file, starts you in
Fortran mode when you edit a Fortran file, and starts you in
Fundamental mode when you edit an unadorned file.  This all makes
sense, if you do not know who is going to use Emacs.  Who knows what a
person hopes to do with an unadorned file?  Fundamental mode is the
right default for such a file, just as C mode is the right default for
editing C code.  (Enough programming languages have syntaxes
that enable them to share or nearly share features, so C mode is
now provided by CC mode, the C Collection.)

   <p>But when you do know who is going to use Emacs&mdash;you,
yourself&mdash;then it makes sense to customize Emacs.

   <p>For example, I seldom want Fundamental mode when I edit an
otherwise undistinguished file; I want Text mode.  This is why I
customize Emacs: so it suits me.

   <p>You can customize and extend Emacs by writing or adapting a
<samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> file.  This is your personal initialization file; its
contents, written in Emacs Lisp, tell Emacs what to do.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

   <p>A <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> file contains Emacs Lisp code.  You can write this
code yourself; or you can use Emacs's <code>customize</code> feature to write
the code for you.  You can combine your own expressions and
auto-written Customize expressions in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.

   <p>(I myself prefer to write my own expressions, except for those,
particularly fonts, that I find easier to manipulate using the
<code>customize</code> command.  I combine the two methods.)

   <p>Most of this chapter is about writing expressions yourself.  It
describes a simple <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file; for more information, see
<a href="../emacs/Init-File.html#Init-File">The Init File</a>, and
<a href="../elisp/Init-File.html#Init-File">The Init File</a>.

   <div class="footnote">
<hr>
<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> You
may also add <samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp> to <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> and call it a
<samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.el</span></samp> file.  In the past, you were forbidden to type the
extra keystrokes that the name <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.el</span></samp> requires, but now
you may.  The new format is consistent with the Emacs Lisp file
naming conventions; the old format saves typing.</p>
