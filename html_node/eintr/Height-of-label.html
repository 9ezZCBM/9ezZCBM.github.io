<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">What height should the label be?</h4>

   <p>The next issue is what height the label should be?  Suppose the maximum
height of tallest column of the graph is seven.  Should the highest
label on the Y axis be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">5 -</span></samp>&rsquo;, and should the graph stick up above
the label?  Or should the highest label be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">7 -</span></samp>&rsquo;, and mark the peak
of the graph?  Or should the highest label be <code>10 -</code>, which is a
multiple of five, and be higher than the topmost value of the graph?

   <p>The latter form is preferred.  Most graphs are drawn within rectangles
whose sides are an integral number of steps long&mdash;5, 10, 15, and so
on for a step distance of five.  But as soon as we decide to use a
step height for the vertical axis, we discover that the simple
expression in the varlist for computing the height is wrong.  The
expression is <code>(apply 'max numbers-list)</code>.  This returns the
precise height, not the maximum height plus whatever is necessary to
round up to the nearest multiple of five.  A more complex expression
is required.

   <p>As usual in cases like this, a complex problem becomes simpler if it is
divided into several smaller problems.

   <p>First, consider the case when the highest value of the graph is an
integral multiple of five&mdash;when it is 5, 10, 15, or some higher
multiple of five.  We can use this value as the Y axis height.

   <p>A fairly simply way to determine whether a number is a multiple of
five is to divide it by five and see if the division results in a
remainder.  If there is no remainder, the number is a multiple of
five.  Thus, seven divided by five has a remainder of two, and seven
is not an integral multiple of five.  Put in slightly different
language, more reminiscent of the classroom, five goes into seven
once, with a remainder of two.  However, five goes into ten twice,
with no remainder: ten is an integral multiple of five.
