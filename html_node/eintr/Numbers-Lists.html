<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Numbers, Lists inside of Lists</h4>

   <p>Lists can also have numbers in them, as in this list: <code>(+ 2 2)</code>. 
This list has a plus-sign, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;, followed by two &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2</span></samp>&rsquo;s, each
separated by whitespace.

   <p>In Lisp, both data and programs are represented the same way; that is,
they are both lists of words, numbers, or other lists, separated by
whitespace and surrounded by parentheses.  (Since a program looks like
data, one program may easily serve as data for another; this is a very
powerful feature of Lisp.)  (Incidentally, these two parenthetical
remarks are <em>not</em> Lisp lists, because they contain &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; as punctuation marks.)

   <p>Here is another list, this time with a list inside of it:

<pre class="smallexample">     '(this list has (a list inside of it))
</pre>
   <p>The components of this list are the words &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">this</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">list</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">has</span></samp>&rsquo;, and the list &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(a list inside of it)</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The interior
list is made up of the words &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">list</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">inside</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">of</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">it</span></samp>&rsquo;.
