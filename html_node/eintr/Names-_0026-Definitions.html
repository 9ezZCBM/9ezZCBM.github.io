<h3 class="section">1.4 Symbol Names and Function Definitions</h3>

<p><a name="index-Symbol-names-29"></a>
We can articulate another characteristic of Lisp based on what we have
discussed so far&mdash;an important characteristic: a symbol, like
<code>+</code>, is not itself the set of instructions for the computer to
carry out.  Instead, the symbol is used, perhaps temporarily, as a way
of locating the definition or set of instructions.  What we see is the
name through which the instructions can be found.  Names of people
work the same way.  I can be referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Bob</span></samp>&rsquo;; however, I am
not the letters &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; but am, or was, the
consciousness consistently associated with a particular life-form. 
The name is not me, but it can be used to refer to me.

   <p>In Lisp, one set of instructions can be attached to several names. 
For example, the computer instructions for adding numbers can be
linked to the symbol <code>plus</code> as well as to the symbol <code>+</code>
(and are in some dialects of Lisp).  Among humans, I can be referred
to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Robert</span></samp>&rsquo; as well as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Bob</span></samp>&rsquo; and by other words as well.

   <p>On the other hand, a symbol can have only one function definition
attached to it at a time.  Otherwise, the computer would be confused as
to which definition to use.  If this were the case among people, only
one person in the world could be named &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Bob</span></samp>&rsquo;.  However, the function
definition to which the name refers can be changed readily. 
(See <a href="Install.html#Install">Install a Function Definition</a>.)

   <p>Since Emacs Lisp is large, it is customary to name symbols in a way
that identifies the part of Emacs to which the function belongs. 
Thus, all the names for functions that deal with Texinfo start with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">texinfo-</span></samp>&rsquo; and those for functions that deal with reading mail
start with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rmail-</span></samp>&rsquo;.
