<h4 class="subsection">8.5.1 <code>defvar</code> and an asterisk</h4>

<p><a name="index-defvar-_0040r_007bfor-a-user-customizable-variable_007d-213"></a><a name="index-defvar-_0040r_007bwith-an-asterisk_007d-214"></a>
In the past, Emacs used the <code>defvar</code> special form both for
internal variables that you would not expect a user to change and for
variables that you do expect a user to change.  Although you can still
use <code>defvar</code> for user customizable variables, please use
<code>defcustom</code> instead, since it provides a path into
the Customization commands.  (See <a href="defcustom.html#defcustom">Specifying Variables using <code>defcustom</code></a>.)

   <p>When you specified a variable using the <code>defvar</code> special form,
you could distinguish a variable that a user might want to change from
others by typing an asterisk, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;, in the first column of its
documentation string.  For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defvar shell-command-default-error-buffer nil
       "*Buffer name for `shell-command' ... error output.
     ... ")
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-set_002dvariable-215"></a>You could (and still can) use the <code>set-variable</code> command to
change the value of <code>shell-command-default-error-buffer</code>
temporarily.  However, options set using <code>set-variable</code> are set
only for the duration of your editing session.  The new values are not
saved between sessions.  Each time Emacs starts, it reads the original
value, unless you change the value within your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file,
either by setting it manually or by using <code>customize</code>. 
See <a href="Emacs-Initialization.html#Emacs-Initialization">Your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> File</a>.

   <p>For me, the major use of the <code>set-variable</code> command is to suggest
variables that I might want to set in my <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.  There
are now more than 700 such variables, far too many to remember
readily.  Fortunately, you can press &lt;TAB&gt; after calling the
<code>M-x set-variable</code> command to see the list of variables. 
(See <a href="../emacs/Examining.html#Examining">Examining and Setting Variables</a>.)
