<h4 class="subsection">1.5.1 Byte Compiling</h4>

<p><a name="index-Byte-compiling-33"></a>
One other aspect of interpreting: the Lisp interpreter is able to
interpret two kinds of entity: humanly readable code, on which we will
focus exclusively, and specially processed code, called <dfn>byte
compiled</dfn> code, which is not humanly readable.  Byte compiled code
runs faster than humanly readable code.

   <p>You can transform humanly readable code into byte compiled code by
running one of the compile commands such as <code>byte-compile-file</code>. 
Byte compiled code is usually stored in a file that ends with a
<samp><span class="file">.elc</span></samp> extension rather than a <samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp> extension.  You will
see both kinds of file in the <samp><span class="file">emacs/lisp</span></samp> directory; the files
to read are those with <samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp> extensions.

   <p>As a practical matter, for most things you might do to customize or
extend Emacs, you do not need to byte compile; and I will not discuss
the topic here.  See <a href="../elisp/Byte-Compilation.html#Byte-Compilation">Byte Compilation</a>, for a full description of byte
compilation.
