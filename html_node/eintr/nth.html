<h3 class="section">7.4 <code>nth</code></h3>

<p><a name="index-nth-179"></a>
The <code>nthcdr</code> function takes the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of a list repeatedly. 
The <code>nth</code> function takes the <span class="sc">car</span> of the result returned by
<code>nthcdr</code>.  It returns the Nth element of the list.

   <p>Thus, if it were not defined in C for speed, the definition of
<code>nth</code> would be:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defun nth (n list)
       "Returns the Nth element of LIST.
     N counts from zero.  If LIST is not that long, nil is returned."
       (car (nthcdr n list)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(Originally, <code>nth</code> was defined in Emacs Lisp in <samp><span class="file">subr.el</span></samp>,
but its definition was redone in C in the 1980s.)

   <p>The <code>nth</code> function returns a single element of a list. 
This can be very convenient.

   <p>Note that the elements are numbered from zero, not one.  That is to
say, the first element of a list, its <span class="sc">car</span> is the zeroth element. 
This zero-based counting often bothers people who
are accustomed to the first element in a list being number one, which
is one-based.

   <p>For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     (nth 0 '("one" "two" "three"))
         &rArr; "one"
     
     (nth 1 '("one" "two" "three"))
         &rArr; "two"
</pre>
   <p>It is worth mentioning that <code>nth</code>, like <code>nthcdr</code> and
<code>cdr</code>, does not change the original list&mdash;the function is
non-destructive.  This is in sharp contrast to the <code>setcar</code> and
<code>setcdr</code> functions.
