<h4 class="subsection">8.1.3 The <code>search-forward</code> Function</h4>

<p><a name="index-search_002dforward-191"></a>
The <code>search-forward</code> function is used to locate the
zapped-for-character in <code>zap-to-char</code>.  If the search is
successful, <code>search-forward</code> leaves point immediately after the
last character in the target string.  (In <code>zap-to-char</code>, the
target string is just one character long.  <code>zap-to-char</code> uses the
function <code>char-to-string</code> to ensure that the computer treats that
character as a string.)  If the search is backwards,
<code>search-forward</code> leaves point just before the first character in
the target.  Also, <code>search-forward</code> returns <code>t</code> for true. 
(Moving point is therefore a side effect.)

   <p>In <code>zap-to-char</code>, the <code>search-forward</code> function looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (search-forward (char-to-string char) nil nil arg)
</pre>
   <p>The <code>search-forward</code> function takes four arguments:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The first argument is the target, what is searched for.  This must be a
string, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"z"</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>As it happens, the argument passed to <code>zap-to-char</code> is a single
character.  Because of the way computers are built, the Lisp
interpreter may treat a single character as being different from a
string of characters.  Inside the computer, a single character has a
different electronic format than a string of one character.  (A single
character can often be recorded in the computer using exactly one
byte; but a string may be longer, and the computer needs to be ready
for this.)  Since the <code>search-forward</code> function searches for a
string, the character that the <code>zap-to-char</code> function receives as
its argument must be converted inside the computer from one format to
the other; otherwise the <code>search-forward</code> function will fail. 
The <code>char-to-string</code> function is used to make this conversion.

     <li>The second argument bounds the search; it is specified as a position in
the buffer.  In this case, the search can go to the end of the buffer,
so no bound is set and the second argument is <code>nil</code>.

     <li>The third argument tells the function what it should do if the search
fails&mdash;it can signal an error (and print a message) or it can return
<code>nil</code>.  A <code>nil</code> as the third argument causes the function to
signal an error when the search fails.

     <li>The fourth argument to <code>search-forward</code> is the repeat count&mdash;how
many occurrences of the string to look for.  This argument is optional
and if the function is called without a repeat count, this argument is
passed the value 1.  If this argument is negative, the search goes
backwards.
        </ol>

   <p>In template form, a <code>search-forward</code> expression looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (search-forward "<var>target-string</var>"
                     <var>limit-of-search</var>
                     <var>what-to-do-if-search-fails</var>
                     <var>repeat-count</var>)
</pre>
   <p>We will look at <code>progn</code> next.
