<h3 class="section">1.1 Lisp Lists</h3>

<p><a name="index-Lisp-Lists-4"></a>
In Lisp, a list looks like this: <code>'(rose violet daisy buttercup)</code>. 
This list is preceded by a single apostrophe.  It could just as well be
written as follows, which looks more like the kind of list you are likely
to be familiar with:

<pre class="smallexample">     '(rose
       violet
       daisy
       buttercup)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The elements of this list are the names of the four different flowers,
separated from each other by whitespace and surrounded by parentheses,
like flowers in a field with a stone wall around them. 
<a name="index-Flowers-in-a-field-5"></a>
