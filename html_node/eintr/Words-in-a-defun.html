<h2 class="chapter">14 Counting Words in a <code>defun</code></h2>

<p><a name="index-Counting-words-in-a-_0040code_007bdefun_007d-278"></a><a name="index-Word-counting-in-a-_0040code_007bdefun_007d-279"></a>
Our next project is to count the number of words in a function
definition.  Clearly, this can be done using some variant of
<code>count-words-example</code>.  See <a href="Counting-Words.html#Counting-Words">Counting via Repetition and Regexps</a>.  If we are just going to count the words in
one definition, it is easy enough to mark the definition with the
<kbd>C-M-h</kbd> (<code>mark-defun</code>) command, and then call
<code>count-words-example</code>.

   <p>However, I am more ambitious: I want to count the words and symbols in
every definition in the Emacs sources and then print a graph that
shows how many functions there are of each length: how many contain 40
to 49 words or symbols, how many contain 50 to 59 words or symbols,
and so on.  I have often been curious how long a typical function is,
and this will tell.
