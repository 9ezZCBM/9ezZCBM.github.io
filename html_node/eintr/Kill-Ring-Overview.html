<h3 class="section">10.1 Kill Ring Overview</h3>

<p><a name="index-Kill-ring-overview-224"></a>
The kill ring is a list of textual strings.  This is what it looks like:

<pre class="smallexample">     ("some text" "a different piece of text" "yet more text")
</pre>
   <p>If this were the contents of my kill ring and I pressed <kbd>C-y</kbd>, the
string of characters saying &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">some text</span></samp>&rsquo; would be inserted in this
buffer where my cursor is located.

   <p>The <code>yank</code> command is also used for duplicating text by copying it. 
The copied text is not cut from the buffer, but a copy of it is put on the
kill ring and is inserted by yanking it back.

   <p>Three functions are used for bringing text back from the kill ring:
<code>yank</code>, which is usually bound to <kbd>C-y</kbd>; <code>yank-pop</code>,
which is usually bound to <kbd>M-y</kbd>; and <code>rotate-yank-pointer</code>,
which is used by the two other functions.

   <p>These functions refer to the kill ring through a variable called the
<code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code>.  Indeed, the insertion code for both the
<code>yank</code> and <code>yank-pop</code> functions is:

<pre class="smallexample">     (insert (car kill-ring-yank-pointer))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(Well, no more.  In GNU Emacs 22, the function has been replaced by
<code>insert-for-yank</code> which calls <code>insert-for-yank-1</code>
repetitively for each <code>yank-handler</code> segment.  In turn,
<code>insert-for-yank-1</code> strips text properties from the inserted text
according to <code>yank-excluded-properties</code>.  Otherwise, it is just
like <code>insert</code>.  We will stick with plain <code>insert</code> since it
is easier to understand.)

   <p>To begin to understand how <code>yank</code> and <code>yank-pop</code> work, it is
first necessary to look at the <code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> variable.
