<h4 class="subsection">7.2.1 Find the Length of a List: <code>length</code></h4>

<p><a name="index-length-177"></a>
You can find out how many elements there are in a list by using the Lisp
function <code>length</code>, as in the following examples:

<pre class="smallexample">     (length '(buttercup))
          &rArr; 1
     
     (length '(daisy buttercup))
          &rArr; 2
     
     (length (cons 'violet '(daisy buttercup)))
          &rArr; 3
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In the third example, the <code>cons</code> function is used to construct a
three element list which is then passed to the <code>length</code> function as
its argument.

   <p>We can also use <code>length</code> to count the number of elements in an
empty list:

<pre class="smallexample">     (length ())
          &rArr; 0
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">As you would expect, the number of elements in an empty list is zero.

   <p>An interesting experiment is to find out what happens if you try to find
the length of no list at all; that is, if you try to call <code>length</code>
without giving it an argument, not even an empty list:

<pre class="smallexample">     (length )
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">What you see, if you evaluate this, is the error message

<pre class="smallexample">     Lisp error: (wrong-number-of-arguments length 0)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This means that the function receives the wrong number of
arguments, zero, when it expects some other number of arguments.  In
this case, one argument is expected, the argument being a list whose
length the function is measuring.  (Note that <em>one</em> list is
<em>one</em> argument, even if the list has many elements inside it.)

   <p>The part of the error message that says &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">length</span></samp>&rsquo; is the name of
the function.
