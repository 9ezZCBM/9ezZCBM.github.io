<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Lists diagrammed</h3>

   <p>For example, the list <code>(rose violet buttercup)</code> has three elements,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rose</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">violet</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">buttercup</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In the computer, the
electronic address of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rose</span></samp>&rsquo; is recorded in a segment of computer
memory along with the address that gives the electronic address of where
the atom &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">violet</span></samp>&rsquo; is located; and that address (the one that tells
where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">violet</span></samp>&rsquo; is located) is kept along with an address that tells
where the address for the atom &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">buttercup</span></samp>&rsquo; is located.

   <p>This sounds more complicated than it is and is easier seen in a diagram:

<!-- clear print-postscript-figures -->
<!-- !!! cons-cell-diagram #1 -->
<pre class="smallexample">         ___ ___      ___ ___      ___ ___
        |___|___|--&gt; |___|___|--&gt; |___|___|--&gt; nil
          |            |            |
          |            |            |
           --&gt; rose     --&gt; violet   --&gt; buttercup
</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

In the diagram, each box represents a word of computer memory that
holds a Lisp object, usually in the form of a memory address.  The boxes,
i.e., the addresses, are in pairs.  Each arrow points to what the address
is the address of, either an atom or another pair of addresses.  The
first box is the electronic address of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rose</span></samp>&rsquo; and the arrow points
to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rose</span></samp>&rsquo;; the second box is the address of the next pair of boxes,
the first part of which is the address of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">violet</span></samp>&rsquo; and the second
part of which is the address of the next pair.  The very last box
points to the symbol <code>nil</code>, which marks the end of the list.

   <p>When a variable is set to a list with a function such as <code>setq</code>,
it stores the address of the first box in the variable.  Thus,
evaluation of the expression

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq bouquet '(rose violet buttercup))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">creates a situation like this:

<!-- cons-cell-diagram #2 -->
<pre class="smallexample">     bouquet
          |
          |     ___ ___      ___ ___      ___ ___
           --&gt; |___|___|--&gt; |___|___|--&gt; |___|___|--&gt; nil
                 |            |            |
                 |            |            |
                  --&gt; rose     --&gt; violet   --&gt; buttercup
</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

In this example, the symbol <code>bouquet</code> holds the address of the first
pair of boxes.

   <p>This same list can be illustrated in a different sort of box notation
like this:

<!-- cons-cell-diagram #2a -->
<pre class="smallexample">     bouquet
      |
      |    --------------       ---------------       ----------------
      |   | car   | cdr  |     | car    | cdr  |     | car     | cdr  |
       --&gt;| rose  |   o-------&gt;| violet |   o-------&gt;| butter- |  nil |
          |       |      |     |        |      |     | cup     |      |
           --------------       ---------------       ----------------
</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

(Symbols consist of more than pairs of addresses, but the structure of
a symbol is made up of addresses.  Indeed, the symbol <code>bouquet</code>
consists of a group of address-boxes, one of which is the address of
the printed word &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bouquet</span></samp>&rsquo;, a second of which is the address of a
function definition attached to the symbol, if any, a third of which
is the address of the first pair of address-boxes for the list
<code>(rose violet buttercup)</code>, and so on.  Here we are showing that
the symbol's third address-box points to the first pair of
address-boxes for the list.)

   <p>If a symbol is set to the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of a list, the list itself is not
changed; the symbol simply has an address further down the list.  (In
the jargon, <span class="sc">car</span> and <span class="sc">cdr</span> are &ldquo;non-destructive&rdquo;.)  Thus,
evaluation of the following expression

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq flowers (cdr bouquet))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">produces this:

<!-- cons-cell-diagram #3 -->
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<pre class="smallexample">     bouquet        flowers
       |              |
       |     ___ ___  |     ___ ___      ___ ___
        --&gt; |   |   |  --&gt; |   |   |    |   |   |
            |___|___|----&gt; |___|___|--&gt; |___|___|--&gt; nil
              |              |            |
              |              |            |
               --&gt; rose       --&gt; violet   --&gt; buttercup
</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

The value of <code>flowers</code> is <code>(violet buttercup)</code>, which is
to say, the symbol <code>flowers</code> holds the address of the pair of
address-boxes, the first of which holds the address of <code>violet</code>,
and the second of which holds the address of <code>buttercup</code>.

   <p>A pair of address-boxes is called a <dfn>cons cell</dfn> or <dfn>dotted
pair</dfn>.  See <a href="../elisp/Cons-Cell-Type.html#Cons-Cell-Type">Cons Cell and List Types</a>, and <a href="../elisp/Dotted-Pair-Notation.html#Dotted-Pair-Notation">Dotted Pair Notation</a>, for more
information about cons cells and dotted pairs.

   <p>The function <code>cons</code> adds a new pair of addresses to the front of
a series of addresses like that shown above.  For example, evaluating
the expression

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq bouquet (cons 'lily bouquet))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">produces:

<!-- cons-cell-diagram #4 -->
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<pre class="smallexample">     bouquet                       flowers
       |                             |
       |     ___ ___        ___ ___  |     ___ ___       ___ ___
        --&gt; |   |   |      |   |   |  --&gt; |   |   |     |   |   |
            |___|___|----&gt; |___|___|----&gt; |___|___|----&gt;|___|___|--&gt; nil
              |              |              |             |
              |              |              |             |
               --&gt; lily      --&gt; rose       --&gt; violet    --&gt; buttercup
</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

However, this does not change the value of the symbol
<code>flowers</code>, as you can see by evaluating the following,

<pre class="smallexample">     (eq (cdr (cdr bouquet)) flowers)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which returns <code>t</code> for true.

   <p>Until it is reset, <code>flowers</code> still has the value
<code>(violet buttercup)</code>; that is, it has the address of the cons
cell whose first address is of <code>violet</code>.  Also, this does not
alter any of the pre-existing cons cells; they are all still there.

   <p>Thus, in Lisp, to get the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of a list, you just get the address
of the next cons cell in the series; to get the <span class="sc">car</span> of a list,
you get the address of the first element of the list; to <code>cons</code> a
new element on a list, you add a new cons cell to the front of the list. 
That is all there is to it!  The underlying structure of Lisp is
brilliantly simple!

   <p>And what does the last address in a series of cons cells refer to?  It
is the address of the empty list, of <code>nil</code>.

   <p>In summary, when a Lisp variable is set to a value, it is provided with
the address of the list to which the variable refers.
