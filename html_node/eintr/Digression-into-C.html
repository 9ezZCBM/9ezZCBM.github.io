<h3 class="section">8.4 Digression into C</h3>

<p><a name="index-delete_002dand_002dextract_002dregion-207"></a><a name="index-C_002c-a-digression-into-208"></a><a name="index-Digression-into-C-209"></a>
The <code>copy-region-as-kill</code> function (see <a href="copy_002dregion_002das_002dkill.html#copy_002dregion_002das_002dkill"><code>copy-region-as-kill</code></a>) uses the <code>filter-buffer-substring</code>
function, which in turn uses the <code>delete-and-extract-region</code>
function.  It removes the contents of a region and you cannot get them
back.

   <p>Unlike the other code discussed here, the
<code>delete-and-extract-region</code> function is not written in Emacs
Lisp; it is written in C and is one of the primitives of the GNU Emacs
system.  Since it is very simple, I will digress briefly from Lisp and
describe it here.

<!-- GNU Emacs 24  in src/editfns.c -->
<!-- the DEFUN for  delete-and-extract-region -->
   <p>Like many of the other Emacs primitives,
<code>delete-and-extract-region</code> is written as an instance of a C
macro, a macro being a template for code.  The complete macro looks
like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     DEFUN ("delete-and-extract-region", Fdelete_and_extract_region,
            Sdelete_and_extract_region, 2, 2, 0,
            doc: /* Delete the text between START and END and return it.  */)
            (Lisp_Object start, Lisp_Object end)
     {
       validate_region (&amp;start, &amp;end);
       if (XINT (start) == XINT (end))
         return empty_unibyte_string;
       return del_range_1 (XINT (start), XINT (end), 1, 1);
     }
</pre>
   <p>Without going into the details of the macro writing process, let me
point out that this macro starts with the word <code>DEFUN</code>.  The word
<code>DEFUN</code> was chosen since the code serves the same purpose as
<code>defun</code> does in Lisp.  (The <code>DEFUN</code> C macro is defined in
<samp><span class="file">emacs/src/lisp.h</span></samp>.)

   <p>The word <code>DEFUN</code> is followed by seven parts inside of
parentheses:

     <ul>
<li>The first part is the name given to the function in Lisp,
<code>delete-and-extract-region</code>.

     <li>The second part is the name of the function in C,
<code>Fdelete_and_extract_region</code>.  By convention, it starts with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Since C does not use hyphens in names, underscores are used
instead.

     <li>The third part is the name for the C constant structure that records
information on this function for internal use.  It is the name of the
function in C but begins with an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">S</span></samp>&rsquo; instead of an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>The fourth and fifth parts specify the minimum and maximum number of
arguments the function can have.  This function demands exactly 2
arguments.

     <li>The sixth part is nearly like the argument that follows the
<code>interactive</code> declaration in a function written in Lisp: a letter
followed, perhaps, by a prompt.  The only difference from Lisp is
when the macro is called with no arguments.  Then you write a <code>0</code>
(which is a null string), as in this macro.

     <p>If you were to specify arguments, you would place them between
quotation marks.  The C macro for <code>goto-char</code> includes
<code>"NGoto char: "</code> in this position to indicate that the function
expects a raw prefix, in this case, a numerical location in a buffer,
and provides a prompt.

     <li>The seventh part is a documentation string, just like the one for a
function written in Emacs Lisp.  This is written as a C comment.  (When
you build Emacs, the program <samp><span class="command">lib-src/make-docfile</span></samp> extracts
these comments and uses them to make the documentation.) 
</ul>

   <p>In a C macro, the formal parameters come next, with a statement of
what kind of object they are, followed by the body
of the macro.  For <code>delete-and-extract-region</code> the body
consists of the following four lines:

<pre class="smallexample">     validate_region (&amp;start, &amp;end);
     if (XINT (start) == XINT (end))
       return empty_unibyte_string;
     return del_range_1 (XINT (start), XINT (end), 1, 1);
</pre>
   <p>The <code>validate_region</code> function checks whether the values
passed as the beginning and end of the region are the proper type and
are within range.  If the beginning and end positions are the same,
then return an empty string.

   <p>The <code>del_range_1</code> function actually deletes the text.  It is a
complex function we will not look into.  It updates the buffer and
does other things.  However, it is worth looking at the two arguments
passed to <code>del_range_1</code>.  These are <code>XINT&nbsp;(start)</code><!-- /@w --> and
<code>XINT&nbsp;(end)</code><!-- /@w -->.

   <p>As far as the C language is concerned, <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> are
two integers that mark the beginning and end of the region to be
deleted<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

   <p>Integer widths depend on the machine, and are typically 32 or 64 bits. 
A few of the bits are used to specify the type of information; the
remaining bits are used as content.

   <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">XINT</span></samp>&rsquo; is a C macro that extracts the relevant number from the
longer collection of bits; the type bits are discarded.

   <p>The command in <code>delete-and-extract-region</code> looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     del_range_1 (XINT (start), XINT (end), 1, 1);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">It deletes the region between the beginning position, <code>start</code>,
and the ending position, <code>end</code>.

   <p>From the point of view of the person writing Lisp, Emacs is all very
simple; but hidden underneath is a great deal of complexity to make it
all work.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> More precisely, and requiring more expert knowledge
to understand, the two integers are of type <code>Lisp_Object</code>, which can
also be a C union instead of an integer type.</p>
