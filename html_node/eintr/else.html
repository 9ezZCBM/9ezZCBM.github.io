<h3 class="section">3.8 If&ndash;then&ndash;else Expressions</h3>

<p><a name="index-Else-128"></a>
An <code>if</code> expression may have an optional third argument, called
the <dfn>else-part</dfn>, for the case when the true-or-false-test returns
false.  When this happens, the second argument or then-part of the
overall <code>if</code> expression is <em>not</em> evaluated, but the third or
else-part <em>is</em> evaluated.  You might think of this as the cloudy
day alternative for the decision &ldquo;if it is warm and sunny, then go to
the beach, else read a book!&rdquo;.

   <p>The word &ldquo;else&rdquo; is not written in the Lisp code; the else-part of an
<code>if</code> expression comes after the then-part.  In the written Lisp, the
else-part is usually written to start on a line of its own and is
indented less than the then-part:

<pre class="smallexample">     (if <var>true-or-false-test</var>
         <var>action-to-carry-out-if-the-test-returns-true</var>
       <var>action-to-carry-out-if-the-test-returns-false</var>)
</pre>
   <p>For example, the following <code>if</code> expression prints the message &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">4
is not greater than 5!</span></samp>&rsquo; when you evaluate it in the usual way:

<pre class="smallexample">     (if (&gt; 4 5)                               ; <span class="roman">if-part</span>
         (message "4 falsely greater than 5!") ; <span class="roman">then-part</span>
       (message "4 is not greater than 5!"))   ; <span class="roman">else-part</span>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note that the different levels of indentation make it easy to
distinguish the then-part from the else-part.  (GNU Emacs has several
commands that automatically indent <code>if</code> expressions correctly. 
See <a href="Typing-Lists.html#Typing-Lists">GNU Emacs Helps You Type Lists</a>.)

   <p>We can extend the <code>type-of-animal</code> function to include an
else-part by simply incorporating an additional part to the <code>if</code>
expression.

   <p>You can see the consequences of doing this if you evaluate the following
version of the <code>type-of-animal</code> function definition to install it
and then evaluate the two subsequent expressions to pass different
arguments to the function.

<pre class="smallexample">     (defun type-of-animal (characteristic)  ; <span class="roman">Second version.</span>
       "Print message in echo area depending on CHARACTERISTIC.
     If the CHARACTERISTIC is the string \"fierce\",
     then warn of a tiger; else say it is not fierce."
       (if (equal characteristic "fierce")
           (message "It is a tiger!")
         (message "It is not fierce!")))
</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<pre class="smallexample">     (type-of-animal "fierce")
     
     (type-of-animal "striped")
</pre>
   <!-- Following sentence rewritten to prevent overfull hbox. -->
<p class="noindent">When you evaluate <code>(type-of-animal "fierce")</code>, you will see the
following message printed in the echo area: <code>"It is a tiger!"</code>; but
when you evaluate <code>(type-of-animal "striped")</code>, you will see
<code>"It is not fierce!"</code>.

   <p>(Of course, if the <var>characteristic</var> were <code>"ferocious"</code>, the
message <code>"It is not fierce!"</code> would be printed; and it would be
misleading!  When you write code, you need to take into account the
possibility that some such argument will be tested by the <code>if</code>
and write your program accordingly.)
