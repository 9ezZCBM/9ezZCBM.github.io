<h4 class="subsection">5.2.3 <code>insert-buffer</code> With an <code>if</code> Instead of an <code>or</code></h4>

<p>The job to be done is to make sure the value of <code>buffer</code> is a
buffer itself and not the name of a buffer.  If the value is the name,
then the buffer itself must be got.

   <p>You can imagine yourself at a conference where an usher is wandering
around holding a list with your name on it and looking for you: the
usher is bound to your name, not to you; but when the usher finds
you and takes your arm, the usher becomes bound to you.

   <p>In Lisp, you might describe this situation like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (if (not (holding-on-to-guest))
         (find-and-take-arm-of-guest))
</pre>
   <p>We want to do the same thing with a buffer&mdash;if we do not have the
buffer itself, we want to get it.

   <p>Using a predicate called <code>bufferp</code> that tells us whether we have a
buffer (rather than its name), we can write the code like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (if (not (bufferp buffer))              ; <span class="roman">if-part</span>
         (setq buffer (get-buffer buffer)))  ; <span class="roman">then-part</span>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here, the true-or-false-test of the <code>if</code> expression is
<code>(not&nbsp;(bufferp&nbsp;buffer))</code><!-- /@w -->; and the then-part is the expression
<code>(setq&nbsp;buffer&nbsp;(get-buffer&nbsp;buffer))</code><!-- /@w -->.

   <p>In the test, the function <code>bufferp</code> returns true if its argument is
a buffer&mdash;but false if its argument is the name of the buffer.  (The
last character of the function name <code>bufferp</code> is the character
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo;; as we saw earlier, such use of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo; is a convention that
indicates that the function is a predicate, which is a term that means
that the function will determine whether some property is true or false. 
See <a href="Wrong-Type-of-Argument.html#Wrong-Type-of-Argument">Using the Wrong Type Object as an Argument</a>.)

   <p>The function <code>not</code> precedes the expression <code>(bufferp buffer)</code>,
so the true-or-false-test looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (not (bufferp buffer))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><code>not</code> is a function that returns true if its argument is false
and false if its argument is true.  So if <code>(bufferp buffer)</code>
returns true, the <code>not</code> expression returns false and vice versa.

   <p>Using this test, the <code>if</code> expression works as follows: when the
value of the variable <code>buffer</code> is actually a buffer rather than
its name, the true-or-false-test returns false and the <code>if</code>
expression does not evaluate the then-part.  This is fine, since we do
not need to do anything to the variable <code>buffer</code> if it really is
a buffer.

   <p>On the other hand, when the value of <code>buffer</code> is not a buffer
itself, but the name of a buffer, the true-or-false-test returns true
and the then-part of the expression is evaluated.  In this case, the
then-part is <code>(setq buffer (get-buffer buffer))</code>.  This
expression uses the <code>get-buffer</code> function to return an actual
buffer itself, given its name.  The <code>setq</code> then sets the variable
<code>buffer</code> to the value of the buffer itself, replacing its previous
value (which was the name of the buffer).
