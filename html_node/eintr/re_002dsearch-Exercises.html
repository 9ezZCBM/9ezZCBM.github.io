<h3 class="section">12.6 Exercises with <code>re-search-forward</code></h3>

     <ul>
<li>Write a function to search for a regular expression that matches two
or more blank lines in sequence.

     <li>Write a function to search for duplicated words, such as &ldquo;the the&rdquo;. 
See <a href="../emacs/Regexps.html#Regexps">Syntax of Regular Expressions</a>, for information on how to write a regexp (a regular
expression) to match a string that is composed of two identical
halves.  You can devise several regexps; some are better than others. 
The function I use is described in an appendix, along with several
regexps.  See <a href="the_002dthe.html#the_002dthe"><code>the-the</code> Duplicated Words Function</a>. 
</ul>
