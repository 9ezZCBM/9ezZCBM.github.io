<h4 class="subsection">8.1.2 The Body of <code>zap-to-char</code></h4>

<p>The body of the <code>zap-to-char</code> function contains the code that
kills (that is, removes) the text in the region from the current
position of the cursor up to and including the specified character.

   <p>The first part of the code looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (if (char-table-p translation-table-for-input)
         (setq char (or (aref translation-table-for-input char) char)))
     (kill-region (point) (progn
                            (search-forward (char-to-string char) nil nil arg)
                            (point)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><code>char-table-p</code> is a hitherto unseen function.  It determines
whether its argument is a character table.  When it is, it sets the
character passed to <code>zap-to-char</code> to one of them, if that
character exists, or to the character itself.  (This becomes important
for certain characters in non-European languages.  The <code>aref</code>
function extracts an element from an array.  It is an array-specific
function that is not described in this document.  See <a href="../elisp/Arrays.html#Arrays">Arrays</a>.)

<p class="noindent"><code>(point)</code> is the current position of the cursor.

   <p>The next part of the code is an expression using <code>progn</code>.  The body
of the <code>progn</code> consists of calls to <code>search-forward</code> and
<code>point</code>.

   <p>It is easier to understand how <code>progn</code> works after learning about
<code>search-forward</code>, so we will look at <code>search-forward</code> and
then at <code>progn</code>.
