<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec"><code>let</code> Prevents Confusion</h4>

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007blocal-variable_007d-defined-114"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bvariable_002c-local_007d_002c-defined-115"></a>The <code>let</code> special form prevents confusion.  <code>let</code> creates a
name for a <dfn>local variable</dfn> that overshadows any use of the same
name outside the <code>let</code> expression.  This is like understanding
that whenever your host refers to &ldquo;the house&rdquo;, he means his house, not
yours.  (Symbols used in argument lists work the same way. 
See <a href="defun.html#defun">The <code>defun</code> Macro</a>.)

   <p>Local variables created by a <code>let</code> expression retain their value
<em>only</em> within the <code>let</code> expression itself (and within
expressions called within the <code>let</code> expression); the local
variables have no effect outside the <code>let</code> expression.

   <p>Another way to think about <code>let</code> is that it is like a <code>setq</code>
that is temporary and local.  The values set by <code>let</code> are
automatically undone when the <code>let</code> is finished.  The setting
only affects expressions that are inside the bounds of the <code>let</code>
expression.  In computer science jargon, we would say the binding of
a symbol is visible only in functions called in the <code>let</code> form;
in Emacs Lisp, scoping is dynamic, not lexical.

   <p><code>let</code> can create more than one variable at once.  Also,
<code>let</code> gives each variable it creates an initial value, either a
value specified by you, or <code>nil</code>.  (In the jargon, this is
binding the variable to the value.)  After <code>let</code> has created
and bound the variables, it executes the code in the body of the
<code>let</code>, and returns the value of the last expression in the body,
as the value of the whole <code>let</code> expression.  (&ldquo;Execute&rdquo; is a jargon
term that means to evaluate a list; it comes from the use of the word
meaning &ldquo;to give practical effect to&rdquo; (<cite>Oxford English
Dictionary</cite>).  Since you evaluate an expression to perform an action,
&ldquo;execute&rdquo; has evolved as a synonym to &ldquo;evaluate&rdquo;.)
