     <ul>
<li>Install the <code>count-words-example</code> function and then cause it to
enter the built-in debugger when you call it.  Run the command on a
region containing two words.  You will need to press <kbd>d</kbd> a
remarkable number of times.  On your system, is a hook called after
the command finishes?  (For information on hooks, see <a href="../elisp/Command-Overview.html#Command-Overview">Command Loop Overview</a>.)

     <li>Copy <code>count-words-example</code> into the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer,
instrument the function for Edebug, and walk through its execution. 
The function does not need to have a bug, although you can introduce
one if you wish.  If the function lacks a bug, the walk-through
completes without problems.

     <li>While running Edebug, type <kbd>?</kbd> to see a list of all the Edebug commands. 
(The <code>global-edebug-prefix</code> is usually <kbd>C-x X</kbd>, i.e.,
<kbd>&lt;CTRL&gt;-x</kbd> followed by an upper case <kbd>X</kbd>; use this prefix
for commands made outside of the Edebug debugging buffer.)

     <li>In the Edebug debugging buffer, use the <kbd>p</kbd>
(<code>edebug-bounce-point</code>) command to see where in the region the
<code>count-words-example</code> is working.

     <li>Move point to some spot further down the function and then type the
<kbd>h</kbd> (<code>edebug-goto-here</code>) command to jump to that location.

     <li>Use the <kbd>t</kbd> (<code>edebug-trace-mode</code>) command to cause Edebug to
walk through the function on its own; use an upper case <kbd>T</kbd> for
<code>edebug-Trace-fast-mode</code>.

     <li>Set a breakpoint, then run Edebug in Trace mode until it reaches the
stopping point. 
</ul>
