<h4 class="subsection">5.3.3 The Complete <code>beginning-of-buffer</code></h4>

<p>Here is the complete text of the <code>beginning-of-buffer</code> function:
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

<!-- In GNU Emacs 22 -->
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun beginning-of-buffer (&amp;optional arg)
       "Move point to the beginning of the buffer;
     leave mark at previous position.
     With \\[universal-argument] prefix,
     do not set mark at previous position.
     With numeric arg N,
     put point N/10 of the way from the beginning.
     
     If the buffer is narrowed,
     this command uses the beginning and size
     of the accessible part of the buffer.
     
     Don't use this command in Lisp programs!
     \(goto-char (point-min)) is faster
     and avoids clobbering the mark."
       (interactive "P")
       (or (consp arg)
           (and transient-mark-mode mark-active)
           (push-mark))
       (let ((size (- (point-max) (point-min))))
         (goto-char (if (and arg (not (consp arg)))
                        (+ (point-min)
                           (if (&gt; size 10000)
                               ;; Avoid overflow for large buffer sizes!
                               (* (prefix-numeric-value arg)
                                  (/ size 10))
                             (/ (+ 10 (* size (prefix-numeric-value arg)))
                                10)))
                      (point-min))))
       (if (and arg (not (consp arg))) (forward-line 1)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Except for two small points, the previous discussion shows how this
function works.  The first point deals with a detail in the
documentation string, and the second point concerns the last line of
the function.

   <p>In the documentation string, there is reference to an expression:

<pre class="smallexample">     \\[universal-argument]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">A &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\</span></samp>&rsquo; is used before the first square bracket of this
expression.  This &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\</span></samp>&rsquo; tells the Lisp interpreter to substitute
whatever key is currently bound to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[...]</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In the case
of <code>universal-argument</code>, that is usually <kbd>C-u</kbd>, but it might
be different.  (See <a href="../elisp/Documentation-Tips.html#Documentation-Tips">Tips for Documentation Strings</a>, for more
information.)

   <p>Finally, the last line of the <code>beginning-of-buffer</code> command says
to move point to the beginning of the next line if the command is
invoked with an argument:

<pre class="smallexample">     (if (and arg (not (consp arg))) (forward-line 1))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This puts the cursor at the beginning of the first line after the
appropriate tenths position in the buffer.  This is a flourish that
means that the cursor is always located <em>at least</em> the requested
tenths of the way through the buffer, which is a nicety that is,
perhaps, not necessary, but which, if it did not occur, would be sure
to draw complaints.  (The <code>(not (consp arg))</code> portion is so that
if you specify the command with a <kbd>C-u</kbd>, but without a number,
that is to say, if the raw prefix argument is simply a cons cell,
the command does not put you at the beginning of the second line.)
