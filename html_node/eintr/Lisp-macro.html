<h4 class="subsection">8.2.2 Lisp macro</h4>

<p><a name="index-Macro_002c-lisp-195"></a><a name="index-Lisp-macro-196"></a>
The part of the <code>condition-case</code> expression that is evaluated in
the expectation that all goes well has a <code>when</code>.  The code uses
<code>when</code> to determine whether the <code>string</code> variable points to
text that exists.

   <p>A <code>when</code> expression is simply a programmers' convenience.  It is
an <code>if</code> without the possibility of an else clause.  In your mind,
you can replace <code>when</code> with <code>if</code> and understand what goes
on.  That is what the Lisp interpreter does.

   <p>Technically speaking, <code>when</code> is a Lisp macro.  A Lisp macro
enables you to define new control constructs and other language
features.  It tells the interpreter how to compute another Lisp
expression which will in turn compute the value.  In this case, the
other expression is an <code>if</code> expression.

   <p>The <code>kill-region</code> function definition also has an <code>unless</code>
macro; it is the converse of <code>when</code>.  The <code>unless</code> macro is
an <code>if</code> without a then clause

   <p>For more about Lisp macros, see <a href="../elisp/Macros.html#Macros">Macros</a>.  The C programming language also
provides macros.  These are different, but also useful.

   <p>Regarding the <code>when</code> macro, in the <code>condition-case</code>
expression, when the string has content, then another conditional
expression is executed.  This is an <code>if</code> with both a then-part
and an else-part.

<pre class="smallexample">     (if (eq last-command 'kill-region)
         (kill-append string (&lt; end beg) yank-handler)
       (kill-new string nil yank-handler))
</pre>
   <p>The then-part is evaluated if the previous command was another call to
<code>kill-region</code>; if not, the else-part is evaluated.

   <p><code>yank-handler</code> is an optional argument to <code>kill-region</code> that
tells the <code>kill-append</code> and <code>kill-new</code> functions how deal
with properties added to the text, such as bold or italics.

   <p><code>last-command</code> is a variable that comes with Emacs that we have
not seen before.  Normally, whenever a function is executed, Emacs
sets the value of <code>last-command</code> to the previous command.

   <p>In this segment of the definition, the <code>if</code> expression checks
whether the previous command was <code>kill-region</code>.  If it was,

<pre class="smallexample">     (kill-append string (&lt; end beg) yank-handler)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">concatenates a copy of the newly clipped text to the just previously
clipped text in the kill ring.
