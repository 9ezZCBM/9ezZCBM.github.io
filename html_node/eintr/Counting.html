<h4 class="subsection">1.9.3 Counting</h4>

<p><a name="index-Counting-65"></a>
Here is an example that shows how to use <code>setq</code> in a counter.  You
might use this to count how many times a part of your program repeats
itself.  First set a variable to zero; then add one to the number each
time the program repeats itself.  To do this, you need a variable that
serves as a counter, and two expressions: an initial <code>setq</code>
expression that sets the counter variable to zero; and a second
<code>setq</code> expression that increments the counter each time it is
evaluated.

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq counter 0)                ; <span class="roman">Let's call this the initializer.</span>
     
     (setq counter (+ counter 1))    ; <span class="roman">This is the incrementer.</span>
     
     counter                         ; <span class="roman">This is the counter.</span>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(The text following the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo; are comments.  See <a href="Change-a-defun.html#Change-a-defun">Change a Function Definition</a>.)

   <p>If you evaluate the first of these expressions, the initializer,
<code>(setq counter 0)</code>, and then evaluate the third expression,
<code>counter</code>, the number <code>0</code> will appear in the echo area.  If
you then evaluate the second expression, the incrementer, <code>(setq
counter (+ counter 1))</code>, the counter will get the value 1.  So if you
again evaluate <code>counter</code>, the number <code>1</code> will appear in the
echo area.  Each time you evaluate the second expression, the value of
the counter will be incremented.

   <p>When you evaluate the incrementer, <code>(setq counter (+ counter 1))</code>,
the Lisp interpreter first evaluates the innermost list; this is the
addition.  In order to evaluate this list, it must evaluate the variable
<code>counter</code> and the number <code>1</code>.  When it evaluates the variable
<code>counter</code>, it receives its current value.  It passes this value and
the number <code>1</code> to the <code>+</code> which adds them together.  The sum
is then returned as the value of the inner list and passed to the
<code>setq</code> which sets the variable <code>counter</code> to this new value. 
Thus, the value of the variable, <code>counter</code>, is changed.
