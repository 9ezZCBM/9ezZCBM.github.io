<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">Recursive Pattern: <em>accumulate</em></h5>

<p><a name="index-Accumulate_002c-type-of-recursive-pattern-247"></a><a name="index-Recursive-pattern-_002d-accumulate-248"></a>
Another recursive pattern is called the <code>accumulate</code> pattern.  In
the <code>accumulate</code> recursive pattern, an action is performed on
every element of a list and the result of that action is accumulated
with the results of performing the action on the other elements.

   <p>This is very like the <code>every</code> pattern using <code>cons</code>, except that
<code>cons</code> is not used, but some other combiner.

   <p>The pattern is:

     <ul>
<li>If a list be empty, return zero or some other constant. 
<li>Else, act on the beginning of the list (the <span class="sc">car</span> of the list),
          <ul>
    <li>    and combine that acted-on element, using <code>+</code> or
    some other combining function, with
    <li>    a recursive call by the function on the rest (the <span class="sc">cdr</span>) of the list. 
    </ul>
     </ul>

   <p>Here is an example:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defun add-elements (numbers-list)
       "Add the elements of NUMBERS-LIST together."
       (if (not numbers-list)
           0
         (+ (car numbers-list) (add-elements (cdr numbers-list)))))
     
     (add-elements '(1 2 3 4))
         &rArr; 10
</pre>
   <p>See <a href="Files-List.html#Files-List">Making a List of Files</a>, for an example of the
accumulate pattern.
