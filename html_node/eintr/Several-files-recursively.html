<h3 class="section">14.8 Recursively Count Words in Different Files</h3>

<p>Besides a <code>while</code> loop, you can work on each of a list of files
with recursion.  A recursive version of <code>lengths-list-many-files</code>
is short and simple.

   <p>The recursive function has the usual parts: the do-again-test, the
next-step-expression, and the recursive call.  The do-again-test
determines whether the function should call itself again, which it
will do if the <code>list-of-files</code> contains any remaining elements;
the next-step-expression resets the <code>list-of-files</code> to the
<span class="sc">cdr</span> of itself, so eventually the list will be empty; and the
recursive call calls itself on the shorter list.  The complete
function is shorter than this description! 
<a name="index-recursive_002dlengths_002dlist_002dmany_002dfiles-287"></a>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun recursive-lengths-list-many-files (list-of-files)
       "Return list of lengths of each defun in LIST-OF-FILES."
       (if list-of-files                     ; <span class="roman">do-again-test</span>
           (append
            (lengths-list-file
             (expand-file-name (car list-of-files)))
            (recursive-lengths-list-many-files
             (cdr list-of-files)))))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In a sentence, the function returns the lengths' list for the first of
the <code>list-of-files</code> appended to the result of calling itself on
the rest of the <code>list-of-files</code>.

   <p>Here is a test of <code>recursive-lengths-list-many-files</code>, along with
the results of running <code>lengths-list-file</code> on each of the files
individually.

   <p>Install <code>recursive-lengths-list-many-files</code> and
<code>lengths-list-file</code>, if necessary, and then evaluate the
following expressions.  You may need to change the files' pathnames;
those here work when this Info file and the Emacs sources are located
in their customary places.  To change the expressions, copy them to
the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer, edit them, and then evaluate them.

   <p>The results are shown after the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&rArr;</span></samp>&rsquo;.  (These results are
for files from Emacs version 22.1.1; files from other versions of
Emacs may produce different results.)

<!-- !!! 22.1.1 lisp sources location here -->
<pre class="smallexample">     (cd "/usr/local/share/emacs/22.1.1/")
     
     (lengths-list-file "./lisp/macros.el")
          &rArr; (283 263 480 90)
     
     (lengths-list-file "./lisp/mail/mailalias.el")
          &rArr; (38 32 29 95 178 180 321 218 324)
     
     (lengths-list-file "./lisp/makesum.el")
          &rArr; (85 181)
     
       (recursive-lengths-list-many-files
        '("./lisp/macros.el"
          "./lisp/mail/mailalias.el"
          "./lisp/makesum.el"))
            &rArr; (283 263 480 90 38 32 29 95 178 180 321 218 324 85 181)
</pre>
   <p>The <code>recursive-lengths-list-many-files</code> function produces the
output we want.

   <p>The next step is to prepare the data in the list for display in a graph.
