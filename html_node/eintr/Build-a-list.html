<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Build a list</h4>

   <p><code>cons</code> must have a list to attach to.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>  You
cannot start from absolutely nothing.  If you are building a list, you
need to provide at least an empty list at the beginning.  Here is a
series of <code>cons</code> expressions that build up a list of flowers.  If
you are reading this in Info in GNU Emacs, you can evaluate each of
the expressions in the usual way; the value is printed in this text
after &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&rArr;</span></samp>&rsquo;, which you may read as &ldquo;evaluates to&rdquo;.

<pre class="smallexample">     (cons 'buttercup ())
          &rArr; (buttercup)
     
     (cons 'daisy '(buttercup))
          &rArr; (daisy buttercup)
     
     (cons 'violet '(daisy buttercup))
          &rArr; (violet daisy buttercup)
     
     (cons 'rose '(violet daisy buttercup))
          &rArr; (rose violet daisy buttercup)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In the first example, the empty list is shown as <code>()</code> and a list
made up of <code>buttercup</code> followed by the empty list is constructed. 
As you can see, the empty list is not shown in the list that was
constructed.  All that you see is <code>(buttercup)</code>.  The empty list is
not counted as an element of a list because there is nothing in an empty
list.  Generally speaking, an empty list is invisible.

   <p>The second example, <code>(cons 'daisy '(buttercup))</code> constructs a new,
two element list by putting <code>daisy</code> in front of <code>buttercup</code>;
and the third example constructs a three element list by putting
<code>violet</code> in front of <code>daisy</code> and <code>buttercup</code>.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> Actually, you can
<code>cons</code> an element to an atom to produce a dotted pair.  Dotted
pairs are not discussed here; see <a href="../elisp/Dotted-Pair-Notation.html#Dotted-Pair-Notation">Dotted Pair Notation</a>.</p>
