<h3 class="section">16.3 Beginning a <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> File</h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007b_002eemacs_007d-file_002c-beginning-of-313"></a>
When you start Emacs, it loads your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file unless you tell
it not to by specifying &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-q</span></samp>&rsquo; on the command line.  (The
<code>emacs -q</code> command gives you a plain, out-of-the-box Emacs.)

   <p>A <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file contains Lisp expressions.  Often, these are no
more than expressions to set values; sometimes they are function
definitions.

   <p>See <a href="../emacs/Init-File.html#Init-File">The Init File <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp></a>, for a short description of initialization files.

   <p>This chapter goes over some of the same ground, but is a walk among
extracts from a complete, long-used <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file&mdash;my own.

   <p>The first part of the file consists of comments: reminders to myself. 
By now, of course, I remember these things, but when I started, I did
not.

<pre class="smallexample">     ;;;; Bob's .emacs file
     ; Robert J. Chassell
     ; 26 September 1985
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Look at that date!  I started this file a long time ago.  I have been
adding to it ever since.

<pre class="smallexample">     ; Each section in this file is introduced by a
     ; line beginning with four semicolons; and each
     ; entry is introduced by a line beginning with
     ; three semicolons.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This describes the usual conventions for comments in Emacs Lisp. 
Everything on a line that follows a semicolon is a comment.  Two,
three, and four semicolons are used as subsection and section markers. 
(See <a href="../elisp/Comments.html#Comments">Comments</a>, for
more about comments.)

<pre class="smallexample">     ;;;; The Help Key
     ; Control-h is the help key;
     ; after typing control-h, type a letter to
     ; indicate the subject about which you want help.
     ; For an explanation of the help facility,
     ; type control-h two times in a row.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Just remember: type <kbd>C-h</kbd> two times for help.

<pre class="smallexample">     ; To find out about any mode, type control-h m
     ; while in that mode.  For example, to find out
     ; about mail mode, enter mail mode and then type
     ; control-h m.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">&ldquo;Mode help&rdquo;, as I call this, is very helpful.  Usually, it tells you
all you need to know.

   <p>Of course, you don't need to include comments like these in your
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.  I included them in mine because I kept forgetting
about Mode help or the conventions for comments&mdash;but I was able to
remember to look here to remind myself.
