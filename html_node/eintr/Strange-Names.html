<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Strange Names</h3>

   <p>The name of the <code>cons</code> function is not unreasonable: it is an
abbreviation of the word &ldquo;construct&rdquo;.  The origins of the names for
<code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code>, on the other hand, are esoteric: <code>car</code>
is an acronym from the phrase &ldquo;Contents of the Address part of the
Register&rdquo;; and <code>cdr</code> (pronounced &ldquo;could-er&rdquo;) is an acronym from
the phrase &ldquo;Contents of the Decrement part of the Register&rdquo;.  These
phrases refer to specific pieces of hardware on the very early
computer on which the original Lisp was developed.  Besides being
obsolete, the phrases have been completely irrelevant for more than 25
years to anyone thinking about Lisp.  Nonetheless, although a few
brave scholars have begun to use more reasonable names for these
functions, the old terms are still in use.  In particular, since the
terms are used in the Emacs Lisp source code, we will use them in this
introduction.
