<h3 class="section">12.2 The <code>re-search-forward</code> Function</h3>

<p><a name="index-re_002dsearch_002dforward-262"></a>
The <code>re-search-forward</code> function is very like the
<code>search-forward</code> function.  (See <a href="search_002dforward.html#search_002dforward">The <code>search-forward</code> Function</a>.)

   <p><code>re-search-forward</code> searches for a regular expression.  If the
search is successful, it leaves point immediately after the last
character in the target.  If the search is backwards, it leaves point
just before the first character in the target.  You may tell
<code>re-search-forward</code> to return <code>t</code> for true.  (Moving point
is therefore a side effect.)

   <p>Like <code>search-forward</code>, the <code>re-search-forward</code> function takes
four arguments:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The first argument is the regular expression that the function searches
for.  The regular expression will be a string between quotation marks.

     <li>The optional second argument limits how far the function will search; it is a
bound, which is specified as a position in the buffer.

     <li>The optional third argument specifies how the function responds to
failure: <code>nil</code> as the third argument causes the function to
signal an error (and print a message) when the search fails; any other
value causes it to return <code>nil</code> if the search fails and <code>t</code>
if the search succeeds.

     <li>The optional fourth argument is the repeat count.  A negative repeat
count causes <code>re-search-forward</code> to search backwards.
        </ol>

   <p>The template for <code>re-search-forward</code> looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (re-search-forward "<var>regular-expression</var>"
                     <var>limit-of-search</var>
                     <var>what-to-do-if-search-fails</var>
                     <var>repeat-count</var>)
</pre>
   <p>The second, third, and fourth arguments are optional.  However, if you
want to pass a value to either or both of the last two arguments, you
must also pass a value to all the preceding arguments.  Otherwise, the
Lisp interpreter will mistake which argument you are passing the value
to.

   <p>In the <code>forward-sentence</code> function, the regular expression will be
the value of the variable <code>sentence-end</code>.  In simple form, that is:

<pre class="smallexample">     "[.?!][]\"')}]*\\($\\|  \\|  \\)[
     ]*"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The limit of the search will be the end of the paragraph (since a
sentence cannot go beyond a paragraph).  If the search fails, the
function will return <code>nil</code>; and the repeat count will be provided
by the argument to the <code>forward-sentence</code> function.
