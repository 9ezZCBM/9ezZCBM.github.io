<h2 class="chapter">15 Readying a Graph</h2>

<p><a name="index-Readying-a-graph-294"></a><a name="index-Graph-prototype-295"></a><a name="index-Prototype-graph-296"></a><a name="index-Body-of-graph-297"></a>
Our goal is to construct a graph showing the numbers of function
definitions of various lengths in the Emacs lisp sources.

   <p>As a practical matter, if you were creating a graph, you would
probably use a program such as <code>gnuplot</code> to do the job. 
(<code>gnuplot</code> is nicely integrated into GNU Emacs.)  In this case,
however, we create one from scratch, and in the process we will
re-acquaint ourselves with some of what we learned before and learn
more.

   <p>In this chapter, we will first write a simple graph printing function. 
This first definition will be a <dfn>prototype</dfn>, a rapidly written
function that enables us to reconnoiter this unknown graph-making
territory.  We will discover dragons, or find that they are myth. 
After scouting the terrain, we will feel more confident and enhance
the function to label the axes automatically.
