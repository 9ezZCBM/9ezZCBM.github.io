Before learning how to write a function definition in Emacs Lisp, it is
useful to spend a little time evaluating various expressions that have
already been written.  These expressions will be lists with the
functions as their first (and often only) element.  Since some of the
functions associated with buffers are both simple and interesting, we
will start with those.  In this section, we will evaluate a few of
these.  In another section, we will study the code of several other
buffer-related functions, to see how they were written.

<ul class="menu">
<li><a accesskey="1" href="How-to-Evaluate.html#How-to-Evaluate">How to Evaluate</a>:             Typing editing commands or <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>
                                 causes evaluation. 
<li><a accesskey="2" href="Buffer-Names.html#Buffer-Names">Buffer Names</a>:                Buffers and files are different. 
<li><a accesskey="3" href="Getting-Buffers.html#Getting-Buffers">Getting Buffers</a>:             Getting a buffer itself, not merely its name. 
<li><a accesskey="4" href="Switching-Buffers.html#Switching-Buffers">Switching Buffers</a>:           How to change to another buffer. 
<li><a accesskey="5" href="Buffer-Size-_0026-Locations.html#Buffer-Size-_0026-Locations">Buffer Size &amp; Locations</a>:     Where point is located and the size of
                               the buffer.
