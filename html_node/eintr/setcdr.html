<h3 class="section">7.6 <code>setcdr</code></h3>

<p><a name="index-setcdr-181"></a>
The <code>setcdr</code> function is similar to the <code>setcar</code> function,
except that the function replaces the second and subsequent elements of
a list rather than the first element.

   <p>(To see how to change the last element of a list, look ahead to
<a href="kill_002dnew-function.html#kill_002dnew-function">The <code>kill-new</code> function</a>, which uses
the <code>nthcdr</code> and <code>setcdr</code> functions.)

   <p>To see how this works, set the value of the variable to a list of
domesticated animals by evaluating the following expression:

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq domesticated-animals '(horse cow sheep goat))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you now evaluate the list, you will be returned the list
<code>(horse cow sheep goat)</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     domesticated-animals
          &rArr; (horse cow sheep goat)
</pre>
   <p>Next, evaluate <code>setcdr</code> with two arguments, the name of the
variable which has a list as its value, and the list to which the
<span class="sc">cdr</span> of the first list will be set;

<pre class="smallexample">     (setcdr domesticated-animals '(cat dog))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you evaluate this expression, the list <code>(cat dog)</code> will appear
in the echo area.  This is the value returned by the function.  The
result we are interested in is the side effect, which we can see by
evaluating the variable <code>domesticated-animals</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     domesticated-animals
          &rArr; (horse cat dog)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Indeed, the list is changed from <code>(horse cow sheep goat)</code> to
<code>(horse cat dog)</code>.  The <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the list is changed from
<code>(cow sheep goat)</code> to <code>(cat dog)</code>.
