<h3 class="section">5.1 The Definition of <code>copy-to-buffer</code></h3>

<p><a name="index-copy_002dto_002dbuffer-152"></a>
After understanding how <code>append-to-buffer</code> works, it is easy to
understand <code>copy-to-buffer</code>.  This function copies text into a
buffer, but instead of adding to the second buffer, it replaces all the
previous text in the second buffer.

   <p>The body of <code>copy-to-buffer</code> looks like this,

<pre class="smallexample">     ...
     (interactive "BCopy to buffer: \nr")
     (let ((oldbuf (current-buffer)))
       (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create buffer)
         (barf-if-buffer-read-only)
         (erase-buffer)
         (save-excursion
           (insert-buffer-substring oldbuf start end)))))
</pre>
   <p>The <code>copy-to-buffer</code> function has a simpler <code>interactive</code>
expression than <code>append-to-buffer</code>.

   <p>The definition then says

<pre class="smallexample">     (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create buffer) ...
</pre>
   <p>First, look at the earliest inner expression; that is evaluated first. 
That expression starts with <code>get-buffer-create buffer</code>.  The
function tells the computer to use the buffer with the name specified
as the one to which you are copying, or if such a buffer does not
exist, to create it.  Then, the <code>with-current-buffer</code> function
evaluates its body with that buffer temporarily current.

   <p>(This demonstrates another way to shift the computer's attention but
not the user's.  The <code>append-to-buffer</code> function showed how to do
the same with <code>save-excursion</code> and <code>set-buffer</code>. 
<code>with-current-buffer</code> is a newer, and arguably easier,
mechanism.)

   <p>The <code>barf-if-buffer-read-only</code> function sends you an error
message saying the buffer is read-only if you cannot modify it.

   <p>The next line has the <code>erase-buffer</code> function as its sole
contents.  That function erases the buffer.

   <p>Finally, the last two lines contain the <code>save-excursion</code>
expression with <code>insert-buffer-substring</code> as its body. 
The  <code>insert-buffer-substring</code> expression copies the text from
the buffer you are in (and you have not seen the computer shift its
attention, so you don't know that that buffer is now called
<code>oldbuf</code>).

   <p>Incidentally, this is what is meant by &ldquo;replacement&rdquo;.  To replace text,
Emacs erases the previous text and then inserts new text.

   <p>In outline, the body of <code>copy-to-buffer</code> looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (let (<var>bind-</var><code>oldbuf</code><var>-to-value-of-</var><code>current-buffer</code>)
         (<var>with-the-buffer-you-are-copying-to</var>
           (<var>but-do-not-erase-or-copy-to-a-read-only-buffer</var>)
           (erase-buffer)
           (save-excursion
             <var>insert-substring-from-</var><code>oldbuf</code><var>-into-buffer</var>)))
</pre>
   </body></html>
