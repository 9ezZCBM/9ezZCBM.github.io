<h4 class="subsection">8.2.1 <code>condition-case</code></h4>

<p><a name="index-condition_002dcase-194"></a>
As we have seen earlier (see <a href="Making-Errors.html#Making-Errors">Generate an Error Message</a>), when the Emacs Lisp interpreter has trouble evaluating an
expression, it provides you with help; in the jargon, this is called
&ldquo;signaling an error&rdquo;.  Usually, the computer stops the program and
shows you a message.

   <p>However, some programs undertake complicated actions.  They should not
simply stop on an error.  In the <code>kill-region</code> function, the most
likely error is that you will try to kill text that is read-only and
cannot be removed.  So the <code>kill-region</code> function contains code
to handle this circumstance.  This code, which makes up the body of
the <code>kill-region</code> function, is inside of a <code>condition-case</code>
special form.

   <p>The template for <code>condition-case</code> looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (condition-case
       <var>var</var>
       <var>bodyform</var>
       <var>error-handler</var>...)
</pre>
   <p>The second argument, <var>bodyform</var>, is straightforward.  The
<code>condition-case</code> special form causes the Lisp interpreter to
evaluate the code in <var>bodyform</var>.  If no error occurs, the special
form returns the code's value and produces the side-effects, if any.

   <p>In short, the <var>bodyform</var> part of a <code>condition-case</code>
expression determines what should happen when everything works
correctly.

   <p>However, if an error occurs, among its other actions, the function
generating the error signal will define one or more error condition
names.

   <p>An error handler is the third argument to <code>condition-case</code>. 
An error handler has two parts, a <var>condition-name</var> and a
<var>body</var>.  If the <var>condition-name</var> part of an error handler
matches a condition name generated by an error, then the <var>body</var>
part of the error handler is run.

   <p>As you will expect, the <var>condition-name</var> part of an error handler
may be either a single condition name or a list of condition names.

   <p>Also, a complete <code>condition-case</code> expression may contain more
than one error handler.  When an error occurs, the first applicable
handler is run.

   <p>Lastly, the first argument to the <code>condition-case</code> expression,
the <var>var</var> argument, is sometimes bound to a variable that
contains information about the error.  However, if that argument is
nil, as is the case in <code>kill-region</code>, that information is
discarded.

   <p>In brief, in the <code>kill-region</code> function, the code
<code>condition-case</code> works like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>If no errors</var>, <var>run only this code</var>
         <var>but</var>, <var>if errors</var>, <var>run this other code</var>.
</pre>
