The <code>save-excursion</code> function is the third and final special form
that we will discuss in this chapter.

   <p>In Emacs Lisp programs used for editing, the <code>save-excursion</code>
function is very common.  It saves the location of point,
executes the body of the function, and then restores point to
its previous position if its location was changed.  Its primary
purpose is to keep the user from being surprised and disturbed by
unexpected movement of point.
