<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Thank You</h3>

<p>My thanks to all who helped me with this book.  My especial thanks to
<span class="roman">Jim Blandy</span>, <span class="roman">Noah Friedman</span>, Jim&nbsp;Kingdon<!-- /@w -->, <span class="roman">Roland
McGrath</span>, Frank&nbsp;Ritter<!-- /@w -->, Randy&nbsp;Smith<!-- /@w -->, Richard&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Stallman<!-- /@w -->, and Melissa&nbsp;Weisshaus<!-- /@w -->.  My thanks also go to both
Philip&nbsp;Johnson<!-- /@w --> and David&nbsp;Stampe<!-- /@w --> for their patient
encouragement.  My mistakes are my own.

<!-- ================ Beginning of main text ================ -->
<!-- Start main text on right-hand (verso) page -->
<!-- Note: this resetting of the page number back to 1 causes TeX to gripe -->
<!-- about already having seen page numbers 1-4 before (in the preface): -->
<!-- pdfTeX warning (ext4): destination with the same identifier (name{1}) -->
<!-- has been already used, duplicate ignored -->
<!-- I guess that is harmless (what happens if a later part of the text -->
<!-- makes a link to something in the first 4 pages though?). -->
<!-- E.g., note that the Emacs manual has a preface, but does not bother -->
<!-- resetting the page numbers back to 1 after that. -->
<!-- Alternatively, uncomment the 3 lines above (search for ``pageno'') -->
<!-- to have the preface numbered in roman numerals. -->
