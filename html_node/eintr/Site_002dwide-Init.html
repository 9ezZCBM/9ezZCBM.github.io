<h3 class="section">16.1 Site-wide Initialization Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bdefault_002eel_007d-init-file-307"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bsite_002dinit_002eel_007d-init-file-308"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bsite_002dload_002eel_007d-init-file-309"></a>In addition to your personal initialization file, Emacs automatically
loads various site-wide initialization files, if they exist.  These
have the same form as your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file, but are loaded by
everyone.

   <p>Two site-wide initialization files, <samp><span class="file">site-load.el</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">site-init.el</span></samp>, are loaded into Emacs and then dumped if a
dumped version of Emacs is created, as is most common.  (Dumped
copies of Emacs load more quickly.  However, once a file is loaded and
dumped, a change to it does not lead to a change in Emacs unless you
load it yourself or re-dump Emacs.  See <a href="../elisp/Building-Emacs.html#Building-Emacs">Building Emacs</a>, and the
<samp><span class="file">INSTALL</span></samp> file.)

   <p>Three other site-wide initialization files are loaded automatically
each time you start Emacs, if they exist.  These are
<samp><span class="file">site-start.el</span></samp>, which is loaded <em>before</em> your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>
file, and <samp><span class="file">default.el</span></samp>, and the terminal type file, which are both
loaded <em>after</em> your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.

   <p>Settings and definitions in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file will overwrite
conflicting settings and definitions in a <samp><span class="file">site-start.el</span></samp> file,
if it exists; but the settings and definitions in a <samp><span class="file">default.el</span></samp>
or terminal type file will overwrite those in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file. 
(You can prevent interference from a terminal type file by setting
<code>term-file-prefix</code> to <code>nil</code>.  See <a href="Simple-Extension.html#Simple-Extension">A Simple Extension</a>.)

<!-- Rewritten to avoid overfull hbox. -->
   <p>The <samp><span class="file">INSTALL</span></samp> file that comes in the distribution contains
descriptions of the <samp><span class="file">site-init.el</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">site-load.el</span></samp> files.

   <p>The <samp><span class="file">loadup.el</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">startup.el</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="file">loaddefs.el</span></samp> files
control loading.  These files are in the <samp><span class="file">lisp</span></samp> directory of the
Emacs distribution and are worth perusing.

   <p>The <samp><span class="file">loaddefs.el</span></samp> file contains a good many suggestions as to
what to put into your own <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file, or into a site-wide
initialization file.
