<h3 class="section">16.8 Keymaps</h3>

<p><a name="index-Keymaps-335"></a><a name="index-Rebinding-keys-336"></a>
Emacs uses <dfn>keymaps</dfn> to record which keys call which commands. 
When you use <code>global-set-key</code> to set the keybinding for a single
command in all parts of Emacs, you are specifying the keybinding in
<code>current-global-map</code>.

   <p>Specific modes, such as C mode or Text mode, have their own keymaps;
the mode-specific keymaps override the global map that is shared by
all buffers.

   <p>The <code>global-set-key</code> function binds, or rebinds, the global
keymap.  For example, the following binds the key <kbd>C-x C-b</kbd> to the
function <code>buffer-menu</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     (global-set-key "\C-x\C-b" 'buffer-menu)
</pre>
   <p>Mode-specific keymaps are bound using the <code>define-key</code> function,
which takes a specific keymap as an argument, as well as the key and
the command.  For example, my <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file contains the
following expression to bind the <code>texinfo-insert-@group</code> command
to <kbd>C-c C-c g</kbd>:

<pre class="smallexample">     (define-key texinfo-mode-map "\C-c\C-cg" 'texinfo-insert-@group)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <code>texinfo-insert-@group</code> function itself is a little extension
to Texinfo mode that inserts &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@group</span></samp>&rsquo; into a Texinfo file.  I
use this command all the time and prefer to type the three strokes
<kbd>C-c C-c g</kbd> rather than the six strokes <kbd>@ g r o u p</kbd>. 
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@group</span></samp>&rsquo; and its matching &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@end group</span></samp>&rsquo; are commands that
keep all enclosed text together on one page; many multi-line examples
in this book are surrounded by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@group ... @end group</span></samp>&rsquo;.)

   <p>Here is the <code>texinfo-insert-@group</code> function definition:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defun texinfo-insert-@group ()
       "Insert the string @group in a Texinfo buffer."
       (interactive)
       (beginning-of-line)
       (insert "@group\n"))
</pre>
   <p>(Of course, I could have used Abbrev mode to save typing, rather than
write a function to insert a word; but I prefer key strokes consistent
with other Texinfo mode key bindings.)

   <p>You will see numerous <code>define-key</code> expressions in
<samp><span class="file">loaddefs.el</span></samp> as well as in the various mode libraries, such as
<samp><span class="file">cc-mode.el</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">lisp-mode.el</span></samp>.

   <p>See <a href="../emacs/Key-Bindings.html#Key-Bindings">Customizing Key Bindings</a>, and <a href="../elisp/Keymaps.html#Keymaps">Keymaps</a>, for more information about keymaps.
