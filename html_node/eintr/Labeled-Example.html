<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Labeled Example Graph</h3>

   <p>Since insertions fill a buffer to the right and below point, the new
graph printing function should first print the Y or vertical axis,
then the body of the graph, and finally the X or horizontal axis. 
This sequence lays out for us the contents of the function:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Set up code.

     <li>Print Y axis.

     <li>Print body of graph.

     <li>Print X axis.
        </ol>

   <p>Here is an example of how a finished graph should look:

<pre class="smallexample">         10 -
                       *
                       *  *
                       *  **
                       *  ***
          5 -      *   *******
                 * *** *******
                 *************
               ***************
          1 - ****************
              |   |    |    |
              1   5   10   15
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this graph, both the vertical and the horizontal axes are labeled
with numbers.  However, in some graphs, the horizontal axis is time
and would be better labeled with months, like this:

<pre class="smallexample">          5 -      *
                 * ** *
                 *******
               ********** **
          1 - **************
              |    ^      |
              Jan  June   Jan
</pre>
   <p>Indeed, with a little thought, we can easily come up with a variety of
vertical and horizontal labeling schemes.  Our task could become
complicated.  But complications breed confusion.  Rather than permit
this, it is better choose a simple labeling scheme for our first
effort, and to modify or replace it later.

   <p>These considerations suggest the following outline for the
<code>print-graph</code> function:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defun print-graph (numbers-list)
       "<var>documentation</var>..."
       (let ((height  ...
             ...))
         (print-Y-axis height ... )
         (graph-body-print numbers-list)
         (print-X-axis ... )))
</pre>
   <p>We can work on each part of the <code>print-graph</code> function definition
in turn.
