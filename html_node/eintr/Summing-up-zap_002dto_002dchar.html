<h4 class="subsection">8.1.5 Summing up <code>zap-to-char</code></h4>

<p>Now that we have seen how <code>search-forward</code> and <code>progn</code> work,
we can see how the <code>zap-to-char</code> function works as a whole.

   <p>The first argument to <code>kill-region</code> is the position of the cursor
when the <code>zap-to-char</code> command is given&mdash;the value of point at
that time.  Within the <code>progn</code>, the search function then moves
point to just after the zapped-to-character and <code>point</code> returns the
value of this location.  The <code>kill-region</code> function puts together
these two values of point, the first one as the beginning of the region
and the second one as the end of the region, and removes the region.

   <p>The <code>progn</code> special form is necessary because the
<code>kill-region</code> command takes two arguments; and it would fail if
<code>search-forward</code> and <code>point</code> expressions were written in
sequence as two additional arguments.  The <code>progn</code> expression is
a single argument to <code>kill-region</code> and returns the one value that
<code>kill-region</code> needs for its second argument.
