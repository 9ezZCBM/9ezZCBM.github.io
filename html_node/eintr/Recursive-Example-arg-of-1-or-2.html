<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">An argument of 1 or 2</h5>

   <p>First, what happens if the value of the argument is 1?

   <p>The function has an <code>if</code> expression after the documentation
string.  It tests whether the value of <code>number</code> is equal to 1; if
so, Emacs evaluates the then-part of the <code>if</code> expression, which
returns the number 1 as the value of the function.  (A triangle with
one row has one pebble in it.)

   <p>Suppose, however, that the value of the argument is 2.  In this case,
Emacs evaluates the else-part of the <code>if</code> expression.

   <p>The else-part consists of an addition, the recursive call to
<code>triangle-recursively</code> and a decrementing action; and it looks like
this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (+ number (triangle-recursively (1- number)))
</pre>
   <p>When Emacs evaluates this expression, the innermost expression is
evaluated first; then the other parts in sequence.  Here are the steps
in detail:

     <dl>
<dt><i>Step 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- /@w --> Evaluate the innermost expression.</i><dd>
The innermost expression is <code>(1- number)</code> so Emacs decrements the
value of <code>number</code> from 2 to 1.

     <br><dt><i>Step 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- /@w --> Evaluate the </i><code>triangle-recursively</code><i> function.</i><dd>
The Lisp interpreter creates an individual instance of
<code>triangle-recursively</code>.  It does not matter that this function is
contained within itself.  Emacs passes the result Step 1 as the
argument used by this instance of the <code>triangle-recursively</code>
function

     <p>In this case, Emacs evaluates <code>triangle-recursively</code> with an
argument of 1.  This means that this evaluation of
<code>triangle-recursively</code> returns 1.

     <br><dt><i>Step 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- /@w --> Evaluate the value of </i><code>number</code><i>.</i><dd>
The variable <code>number</code> is the second element of the list that
starts with <code>+</code>; its value is 2.

     <br><dt><i>Step 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- /@w --> Evaluate the </i><code>+</code><i> expression.</i><dd>
The <code>+</code> expression receives two arguments, the first
from the evaluation of <code>number</code> (Step 3) and the second from the
evaluation of <code>triangle-recursively</code> (Step 2).

     <p>The result of the addition is the sum of 2 plus 1, and the number 3 is
returned, which is correct.  A triangle with two rows has three
pebbles in it.
