<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">The Complete <code>zap-to-char</code> Implementation</h4>

   <p>The <code>zap-to-char</code> function removes the text in the region between
the location of the cursor (i.e., of point) up to and including the
next occurrence of a specified character.  The text that
<code>zap-to-char</code> removes is put in the kill ring; and it can be
retrieved from the kill ring by typing <kbd>C-y</kbd> (<code>yank</code>).  If
the command is given an argument, it removes text through that number
of occurrences.  Thus, if the cursor were at the beginning of this
sentence and the character were &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Thus</span></samp>&rsquo; would be
removed.  If the argument were two, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Thus, if the curs</span></samp>&rsquo; would be
removed, up to and including the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>&rsquo; in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cursor</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>If the specified character is not found, <code>zap-to-char</code> will say
&ldquo;Search failed&rdquo;, tell you the character you typed, and not remove
any text.

   <p>In order to determine how much text to remove, <code>zap-to-char</code> uses
a search function.  Searches are used extensively in code that
manipulates text, and we will focus attention on them as well as on the
deletion command.

   <p>Here is the complete text of the version 22 implementation of the function:

<!-- GNU Emacs 22 -->
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun zap-to-char (arg char)
       "Kill up to and including ARG'th occurrence of CHAR.
     Case is ignored if `case-fold-search' is non-nil in the current buffer.
     Goes backward if ARG is negative; error if CHAR not found."
       (interactive "p\ncZap to char: ")
       (if (char-table-p translation-table-for-input)
           (setq char (or (aref translation-table-for-input char) char)))
       (kill-region (point) (progn
                              (search-forward (char-to-string char)
                                              nil nil arg)
                              (point))))
</pre>
   <p>The documentation is thorough.  You do need to know the jargon meaning
of the word &ldquo;kill&rdquo;.

   <p><a name="index-curved-quotes-189"></a><a name="index-curly-quotes-190"></a>The version 22 documentation string for <code>zap-to-char</code> uses ASCII
grave accent and apostrophe to quote a symbol, so it appears as
<tt>`case-fold-search'</tt>.  This quoting style was inspired by 1970s-era
displays in which grave accent and apostrophe were often mirror images
suitable for use as quotes.  On most modern displays this is no longer
true, and when these two ASCII characters appear in documentation
strings or diagnostic message formats, Emacs typically transliterates
them to <dfn>curved quotes</dfn> (left and right single quotation marks),
so that the abovequoted symbol appears
as <tt>‘case-fold-search’</tt>.  Source-code strings can also simply use
curved quotes directly.
