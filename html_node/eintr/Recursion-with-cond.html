<h4 class="subsection">11.3.5 Recursion Example Using <code>cond</code></h4>

<p><a name="index-cond-243"></a>
The version of <code>triangle-recursively</code> described earlier is written
with the <code>if</code> special form.  It can also be written using another
special form called <code>cond</code>.  The name of the special form
<code>cond</code> is an abbreviation of the word &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">conditional</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Although the <code>cond</code> special form is not used as often in the
Emacs Lisp sources as <code>if</code>, it is used often enough to justify
explaining it.

   <p>The template for a <code>cond</code> expression looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (cond
      <var>body</var>...)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where the <var>body</var> is a series of lists.

   <p>Written out more fully, the template looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (cond
      (<var>first-true-or-false-test</var> <var>first-consequent</var>)
      (<var>second-true-or-false-test</var> <var>second-consequent</var>)
      (<var>third-true-or-false-test</var> <var>third-consequent</var>)
       ...)
</pre>
   <p>When the Lisp interpreter evaluates the <code>cond</code> expression, it
evaluates the first element (the <span class="sc">car</span> or true-or-false-test) of
the first expression in a series of expressions within the body of the
<code>cond</code>.

   <p>If the true-or-false-test returns <code>nil</code> the rest of that
expression, the consequent, is skipped and  the true-or-false-test of the
next expression is evaluated.  When an expression is found whose
true-or-false-test returns a value that is not <code>nil</code>, the
consequent of that expression is evaluated.  The consequent can be one
or more expressions.  If the consequent consists of more than one
expression, the expressions are evaluated in sequence and the value of
the last one is returned.  If the expression does not have a consequent,
the value of the true-or-false-test is returned.

   <p>If none of the true-or-false-tests test true, the <code>cond</code> expression
returns <code>nil</code>.

   <p>Written using <code>cond</code>, the <code>triangle</code> function looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defun triangle-using-cond (number)
       (cond ((&lt;= number 0) 0)
             ((= number 1) 1)
             ((&gt; number 1)
              (+ number (triangle-using-cond (1- number))))))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this example, the <code>cond</code> returns 0 if the number is less than or
equal to 0, it returns 1 if the number is 1 and it evaluates <code>(+
number (triangle-using-cond (1- number)))</code> if the number is greater than
1.
