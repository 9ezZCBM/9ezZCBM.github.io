<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">An Interactive <code>multiply-by-seven</code>, An Overview</h4>

   <p>Both the use of the special form <code>interactive</code> and one way to
display a value in the echo area can be illustrated by creating an
interactive version of <code>multiply-by-seven</code>.

   <p>Here is the code:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defun multiply-by-seven (number)       ; <span class="roman">Interactive version.</span>
       "Multiply NUMBER by seven."
       (interactive "p")
       (message "The result is %d" (* 7 number)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You can install this code by placing your cursor after it and typing
<kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>.  The name of the function will appear in your echo area. 
Then, you can use this code by typing <kbd>C-u</kbd> and a number and then
typing <kbd>M-x multiply-by-seven</kbd> and pressing &lt;RET&gt;.  The phrase
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">The result is ...</span></samp>&rsquo; followed by the product will appear in the
echo area.

   <p>Speaking more generally, you invoke a function like this in either of two
ways:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>By typing a prefix argument that contains the number to be passed, and
then typing <kbd>M-x</kbd> and the name of the function, as with
<kbd>C-u 3 M-x forward-sentence</kbd>; or,

     <li>By typing whatever key or keychord the function is bound to, as with
<kbd>C-u 3 M-e</kbd>.
        </ol>

<p class="noindent">Both the examples just mentioned work identically to move point forward
three sentences.  (Since <code>multiply-by-seven</code> is not bound to a key,
it could not be used as an example of key binding.)

   <p>(See <a href="Keybindings.html#Keybindings">Some Keybindings</a>, to learn how to bind a command
to a key.)

   <p>A <dfn>prefix argument</dfn> is passed to an interactive function by typing the
&lt;META&gt; key followed by a number, for example, <kbd>M-3 M-e</kbd>, or by
typing <kbd>C-u</kbd> and then a number, for example, <kbd>C-u 3 M-e</kbd> (if you
type <kbd>C-u</kbd> without a number, it defaults to 4).
