<h3 class="section">12.1 The Regular Expression for <code>sentence-end</code></h3>

<p><a name="index-sentence_002dend-261"></a>
The symbol <code>sentence-end</code> is bound to the pattern that marks the
end of a sentence.  What should this regular expression be?

   <p>Clearly, a sentence may be ended by a period, a question mark, or an
exclamation mark.  Indeed, in English, only clauses that end with one
of those three characters should be considered the end of a sentence. 
This means that the pattern should include the character set:

<pre class="smallexample">     [.?!]
</pre>
   <p>However, we do not want <code>forward-sentence</code> merely to jump to a
period, a question mark, or an exclamation mark, because such a character
might be used in the middle of a sentence.  A period, for example, is
used after abbreviations.  So other information is needed.

   <p>According to convention, you type two spaces after every sentence, but
only one space after a period, a question mark, or an exclamation mark in
the body of a sentence.  So a period, a question mark, or an exclamation
mark followed by two spaces is a good indicator of an end of sentence. 
However, in a file, the two spaces may instead be a tab or the end of a
line.  This means that the regular expression should include these three
items as alternatives.

   <p>This group of alternatives will look like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     \\($\\| \\|  \\)
            ^   ^^
           TAB  SPC
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; indicates the end of the line, and I have pointed out
where the tab and two spaces are inserted in the expression.  Both are
inserted by putting the actual characters into the expression.

   <p>Two backslashes, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\</span></samp>&rsquo;, are required before the parentheses and
vertical bars: the first backslash quotes the following backslash in
Emacs; and the second indicates that the following character, the
parenthesis or the vertical bar, is special.

   <p>Also, a sentence may be followed by one or more carriage returns, like
this:

<pre class="smallexample">     [
     ]*
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Like tabs and spaces, a carriage return is inserted into a regular
expression by inserting it literally.  The asterisk indicates that the
&lt;RET&gt; is repeated zero or more times.

   <p>But a sentence end does not consist only of a period, a question mark or
an exclamation mark followed by appropriate space: a closing quotation
mark or a closing brace of some kind may precede the space.  Indeed more
than one such mark or brace may precede the space.  These require a
expression that looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     []\"')}]*
</pre>
   <p>In this expression, the first &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo; is the first character in the
expression; the second character is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>&rsquo;, which is preceded by a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; to tell Emacs the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>&rsquo; is <em>not</em> special.  The last
three characters are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">'</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">}</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>All this suggests what the regular expression pattern for matching the
end of a sentence should be; and, indeed, if we evaluate
<code>sentence-end</code> we find that it returns the following value:

<pre class="smallexample">     sentence-end
          &rArr; "[.?!][]\"')}]*\\($\\|     \\|  \\)[
     ]*"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(Well, not in GNU Emacs 22; that is because of an effort to make the
process simpler and to handle more glyphs and languages.  When the
value of <code>sentence-end</code> is <code>nil</code>, then use the value defined
by the function <code>sentence-end</code>.  (Here is a use of the difference
between a value and a function in Emacs Lisp.)  The function returns a
value constructed from the variables <code>sentence-end-base</code>,
<code>sentence-end-double-space</code>, <code>sentence-end-without-period</code>,
and <code>sentence-end-without-space</code>.  The critical variable is
<code>sentence-end-base</code>; its global value is similar to the one
described above but it also contains two additional quotation marks. 
These have differing degrees of curliness.  The
<code>sentence-end-without-period</code> variable, when true, tells Emacs
that a sentence may end without a period, such as text in Thai.)
