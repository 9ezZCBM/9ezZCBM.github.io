<h4 class="subsection">5.2.4 The <code>or</code> in the Body</h4>

<p>The purpose of the <code>or</code> expression in the <code>insert-buffer</code>
function is to ensure that the argument <code>buffer</code> is bound to a
buffer and not just to the name of a buffer.  The previous section shows
how the job could have been done using an <code>if</code> expression. 
However, the <code>insert-buffer</code> function actually uses <code>or</code>. 
To understand this, it is necessary to understand how <code>or</code> works.

   <p><a name="index-or-158"></a>An <code>or</code> function can have any number of arguments.  It evaluates
each argument in turn and returns the value of the first of its
arguments that is not <code>nil</code>.  Also, and this is a crucial feature
of <code>or</code>, it does not evaluate any subsequent arguments after
returning the first non-<code>nil</code> value.

   <p>The <code>or</code> expression looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (or (bufferp buffer)
         (setq buffer (get-buffer buffer)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first argument to <code>or</code> is the expression <code>(bufferp buffer)</code>. 
This expression returns true (a non-<code>nil</code> value) if the buffer is
actually a buffer, and not just the name of a buffer.  In the <code>or</code>
expression, if this is the case, the <code>or</code> expression returns this
true value and does not evaluate the next expression&mdash;and this is fine
with us, since we do not want to do anything to the value of
<code>buffer</code> if it really is a buffer.

   <p>On the other hand, if the value of <code>(bufferp buffer)</code> is <code>nil</code>,
which it will be if the value of <code>buffer</code> is the name of a buffer,
the Lisp interpreter evaluates the next element of the <code>or</code>
expression.  This is the expression <code>(setq buffer (get-buffer
buffer))</code>.  This expression returns a non-<code>nil</code> value, which
is the value to which it sets the variable <code>buffer</code>&mdash;and this
value is a buffer itself, not the name of a buffer.

   <p>The result of all this is that the symbol <code>buffer</code> is always
bound to a buffer itself rather than to the name of a buffer.  All
this is necessary because the <code>set-buffer</code> function in a
following line only works with a buffer itself, not with the name to a
buffer.

   <p>Incidentally, using <code>or</code>, the situation with the usher would be
written like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (or (holding-on-to-guest) (find-and-take-arm-of-guest))
</pre>
   </body></html>
