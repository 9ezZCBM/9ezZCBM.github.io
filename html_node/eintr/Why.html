<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Why Study Emacs Lisp?</h3>

   <p>Although Emacs Lisp is usually thought of in association only with Emacs,
it is a full computer programming language.  You can use Emacs Lisp as
you would any other programming language.

   <p>Perhaps you want to understand programming; perhaps you want to extend
Emacs; or perhaps you want to become a programmer.  This introduction to
Emacs Lisp is designed to get you started: to guide you in learning the
fundamentals of programming, and more importantly, to show you how you
can teach yourself to go further.
