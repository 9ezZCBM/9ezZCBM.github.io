<h3 class="section">6.1 The <code>save-restriction</code> Special Form</h3>

<p><a name="index-save_002drestriction-170"></a>
In Emacs Lisp, you can use the <code>save-restriction</code> special form to
keep track of whatever narrowing is in effect, if any.  When the Lisp
interpreter meets with <code>save-restriction</code>, it executes the code
in the body of the <code>save-restriction</code> expression, and then undoes
any changes to narrowing that the code caused.  If, for example, the
buffer is narrowed and the code that follows <code>save-restriction</code>
gets rid of the narrowing, <code>save-restriction</code> returns the buffer
to its narrowed region afterwards.  In the <code>what-line</code> command,
any narrowing the buffer may have is undone by the <code>widen</code>
command that immediately follows the <code>save-restriction</code> command. 
Any original narrowing is restored just before the completion of the
function.

   <p>The template for a <code>save-restriction</code> expression is simple:

<pre class="smallexample">     (save-restriction
       <var>body</var>... )
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The body of the <code>save-restriction</code> is one or more expressions that
will be evaluated in sequence by the Lisp interpreter.

   <p>Finally, a point to note: when you use both <code>save-excursion</code> and
<code>save-restriction</code>, one right after the other, you should use
<code>save-excursion</code> outermost.  If you write them in reverse order,
you may fail to record narrowing in the buffer to which Emacs switches
after calling <code>save-excursion</code>.  Thus, when written together,
<code>save-excursion</code> and <code>save-restriction</code> should be written
like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (save-excursion
       (save-restriction
         <var>body</var>...))
</pre>
   <p>In other circumstances, when not written together, the
<code>save-excursion</code> and <code>save-restriction</code> special forms must
be written in the order appropriate to the function.

   <p>For example,

<pre class="smallexample">       (save-restriction
         (widen)
         (save-excursion
         <var>body</var>...))
</pre>
   </body></html>
