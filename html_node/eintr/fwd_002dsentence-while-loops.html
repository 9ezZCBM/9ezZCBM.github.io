<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">The <code>while</code> loops</h4>

<p>Two <code>while</code> loops follow.  The first <code>while</code> has a
true-or-false-test that tests true if the prefix argument for
<code>forward-sentence</code> is a negative number.  This is for going
backwards.  The body of this loop is similar to the body of the second
<code>while</code> clause, but it is not exactly the same.  We will skip
this <code>while</code> loop and concentrate on the second <code>while</code>
loop.

   <p>The second <code>while</code> loop is for moving point forward.  Its skeleton
looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (while (&gt; arg 0)            ; <span class="roman">true-or-false-test</span>
       (let <var>varlist</var>
         (if (<var>true-or-false-test</var>)
             <var>then-part</var>
           <var>else-part</var>
       (setq arg (1- arg))))     ; <code>while</code> <span class="roman">loop decrementer</span>
</pre>
   <p>The <code>while</code> loop is of the decrementing kind. 
(See <a href="Decrementing-Loop.html#Decrementing-Loop">A Loop with a Decrementing Counter</a>.)  It
has a true-or-false-test that tests true so long as the counter (in
this case, the variable <code>arg</code>) is greater than zero; and it has a
decrementer that subtracts 1 from the value of the counter every time
the loop repeats.

   <p>If no prefix argument is given to <code>forward-sentence</code>, which is
the most common way the command is used, this <code>while</code> loop will
run once, since the value of <code>arg</code> will be 1.

   <p>The body of the <code>while</code> loop consists of a <code>let</code> expression,
which creates and binds a local variable, and has, as its body, an
<code>if</code> expression.

   <p>The body of the <code>while</code> loop looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (let ((par-end
            (save-excursion (end-of-paragraph-text) (point))))
       (if (re-search-forward sentence-end par-end t)
           (skip-chars-backward " \t\n")
         (goto-char par-end)))
</pre>
   <p>The <code>let</code> expression creates and binds the local variable
<code>par-end</code>.  As we shall see, this local variable is designed to
provide a bound or limit to the regular expression search.  If the
search fails to find a proper sentence ending in the paragraph, it will
stop on reaching the end of the paragraph.

   <p>But first, let us examine how <code>par-end</code> is bound to the value of
the end of the paragraph.  What happens is that the <code>let</code> sets the
value of <code>par-end</code> to the value returned when the Lisp interpreter
evaluates the expression

<pre class="smallexample">     (save-excursion (end-of-paragraph-text) (point))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this expression, <code>(end-of-paragraph-text)</code> moves point to the
end of the paragraph, <code>(point)</code> returns the value of point, and then
<code>save-excursion</code> restores point to its original position.  Thus,
the <code>let</code> binds <code>par-end</code> to the value returned by the
<code>save-excursion</code> expression, which is the position of the end of
the paragraph.  (The <code>end-of-paragraph-text</code> function uses
<code>forward-paragraph</code>, which we will discuss shortly.)

   <p>Emacs next evaluates the body of the <code>let</code>, which is an <code>if</code>
expression that looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (if (re-search-forward sentence-end par-end t) ; <span class="roman">if-part</span>
         (skip-chars-backward " \t\n")              ; <span class="roman">then-part</span>
       (goto-char par-end)))                        ; <span class="roman">else-part</span>
</pre>
   <p>The <code>if</code> tests whether its first argument is true and if so,
evaluates its then-part; otherwise, the Emacs Lisp interpreter
evaluates the else-part.  The true-or-false-test of the <code>if</code>
expression is the regular expression search.

   <p>It may seem odd to have what looks like the real work of
the <code>forward-sentence</code> function buried here, but this is a common
way this kind of operation is carried out in Lisp.
