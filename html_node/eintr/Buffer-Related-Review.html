<h3 class="section">4.5 Review</h3>

<p>Here is a brief summary of the various functions discussed in this chapter.

     <dl>
<dt><code>describe-function</code><dt><code>describe-variable</code><dd>Print the documentation for a function or variable. 
Conventionally bound to <kbd>C-h f</kbd> and <kbd>C-h v</kbd>.

     <br><dt><code>xref-find-definitions</code><dd>Find the file containing the source for a function or variable and
switch buffers to it, positioning point at the beginning of the item. 
Conventionally bound to <kbd>M-.</kbd> (that's a period following the
&lt;META&gt; key).

     <br><dt><code>save-excursion</code><dd>Save the location of point and restore its value after the
arguments to <code>save-excursion</code> have been evaluated.  Also, remember
the current buffer and return to it.

     <br><dt><code>push-mark</code><dd>Set mark at a location and record the value of the previous mark on the
mark ring.  The mark is a location in the buffer that will keep its
relative position even if text is added to or removed from the buffer.

     <br><dt><code>goto-char</code><dd>Set point to the location specified by the value of the argument, which
can be a number, a marker,  or an expression that returns the number of
a position, such as <code>(point-min)</code>.

     <br><dt><code>insert-buffer-substring</code><dd>Copy a region of text from a buffer that is passed to the function as
an argument and insert the region into the current buffer.

     <br><dt><code>mark-whole-buffer</code><dd>Mark the whole buffer as a region.  Normally bound to <kbd>C-x h</kbd>.

     <br><dt><code>set-buffer</code><dd>Switch the attention of Emacs to another buffer, but do not change the
window being displayed.  Used when the program rather than a human is
to work on a different buffer.

     <br><dt><code>get-buffer-create</code><dt><code>get-buffer</code><dd>Find a named buffer or create one if a buffer of that name does not
exist.  The <code>get-buffer</code> function returns <code>nil</code> if the named
buffer does not exist.
