<h4 class="subsection">1.1.2 Whitespace in Lists</h4>

<p><a name="index-Whitespace-in-lists-13"></a>
The amount of whitespace in a list does not matter.  From the point of view
of the Lisp language,

<pre class="smallexample">     '(this list
        looks like this)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is exactly the same as this:

<pre class="smallexample">     '(this list looks like this)
</pre>
   <p>Both examples show what to Lisp is the same list, the list made up of
the symbols &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">this</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">list</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">looks</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">like</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">this</span></samp>&rsquo; in that order.

   <p>Extra whitespace and newlines are designed to make a list more readable
by humans.  When Lisp reads the expression, it gets rid of all the extra
whitespace (but it needs to have at least one space between atoms in
order to tell them apart.)

   <p>Odd as it seems, the examples we have seen cover almost all of what Lisp
lists look like!  Every other list in Lisp looks more or less like one
of these examples, except that the list may be longer and more complex. 
In brief, a list is between parentheses, a string is between quotation
marks, a symbol looks like a word, and a number looks like a number. 
(For certain situations, square brackets, dots and a few other special
characters may be used; however, we will go quite far without them.)
