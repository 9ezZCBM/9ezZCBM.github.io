<h3 class="section">16.7 Some Keybindings</h3>

<p>Now for some personal keybindings:

<pre class="smallexample">     ;;; Compare windows
     (global-set-key "\C-cw" 'compare-windows)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-compare_002dwindows-324"></a><code>compare-windows</code> is a nifty command that compares the text in
your current window with text in the next window.  It makes the
comparison by starting at point in each window, moving over text in
each window as far as they match.  I use this command all the time.

   <p>This also shows how to set a key globally, for all modes.

   <p><a name="index-Setting-a-key-globally-325"></a><a name="index-Global-set-key-326"></a><a name="index-Key-setting-globally-327"></a><a name="index-global_002dset_002dkey-328"></a>The command is <code>global-set-key</code>.  It is followed by the
keybinding.  In a <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file, the keybinding is written as
shown: <code>\C-c</code> stands for Control-C, which means to press the
control key and the <kbd>c</kbd> key at the same time.  The <code>w</code> means
to press the <kbd>w</kbd> key.  The keybinding is surrounded by double
quotation marks.  In documentation, you would write this as
<kbd>C-c&nbsp;w</kbd><!-- /@w -->.  (If you were binding a &lt;META&gt; key, such as
<kbd>M-c</kbd>, rather than a &lt;CTRL&gt; key, you would write
<code>\M-c</code><!-- /@w --> in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.  See <a href="../emacs/Init-Rebinding.html#Init-Rebinding">Rebinding Keys in Your Init File</a>, for
details.)

   <p>The command invoked by the keys is <code>compare-windows</code>.  Note that
<code>compare-windows</code> is preceded by a single-quote; otherwise, Emacs
would first try to evaluate the symbol to determine its value.

   <p>These three things, the double quotation marks, the backslash before
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>&rsquo;, and the single-quote are necessary parts of
keybinding that I tend to forget.  Fortunately, I have come to
remember that I should look at my existing <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file, and
adapt what is there.

   <p>As for the keybinding itself: <kbd>C-c w</kbd>.  This combines the prefix
key, <kbd>C-c</kbd>, with a single character, in this case, <kbd>w</kbd>.  This
set of keys, <kbd>C-c</kbd> followed by a single character, is strictly
reserved for individuals' own use.  (I call these <dfn>own</dfn> keys, since
these are for my own use.)  You should always be able to create such a
keybinding for your own use without stomping on someone else's
keybinding.  If you ever write an extension to Emacs, please avoid
taking any of these keys for public use.  Create a key like <kbd>C-c
C-w</kbd> instead.  Otherwise, we will run out of own keys.

   <p>Here is another keybinding, with a comment:

<pre class="smallexample">     ;;; Keybinding for 'occur'
     ; I use occur a lot, so let's bind it to a key:
     (global-set-key "\C-co" 'occur)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-occur-329"></a>The <code>occur</code> command shows all the lines in the current buffer
that contain a match for a regular expression.  When the region is
active, <code>occur</code> restricts matches to such region.  Otherwise it
uses the entire buffer. 
Matching lines are shown in a buffer called <samp><span class="file">*Occur*</span></samp>. 
That buffer serves as a menu to jump to occurrences.

   <p><a name="index-global_002dunset_002dkey-330"></a><a name="index-Unbinding-key-331"></a><a name="index-Key-unbinding-332"></a>Here is how to unbind a key, so it does not
work:

<pre class="smallexample">     ;;; Unbind 'C-x f'
     (global-unset-key "\C-xf")
</pre>
   <p>There is a reason for this unbinding: I found I inadvertently typed
<kbd>C-x&nbsp;f</kbd><!-- /@w --> when I meant to type <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>.  Rather than find a
file, as I intended, I accidentally set the width for filled text,
almost always to a width I did not want.  Since I hardly ever reset my
default width, I simply unbound the key.

   <p><a name="index-list_002dbuffers_0040r_007b_002c-rebound_007d-333"></a><a name="index-buffer_002dmenu_0040r_007b_002c-bound-to-key_007d-334"></a>The following rebinds an existing key:

<pre class="smallexample">     ;;; Rebind 'C-x C-b' for 'buffer-menu'
     (global-set-key "\C-x\C-b" 'buffer-menu)
</pre>
   <p>By default, <kbd>C-x C-b</kbd> runs the
<code>list-buffers</code> command.  This command lists
your buffers in <em>another</em> window.  Since I
almost always want to do something in that
window, I prefer the  <code>buffer-menu</code>
command, which not only lists the buffers,
but moves point into that window.
