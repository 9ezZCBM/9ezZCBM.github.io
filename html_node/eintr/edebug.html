<h3 class="section">17.4 The <code>edebug</code> Source Level Debugger</h3>

<p><a name="index-Source-level-debugger-358"></a><a name="index-edebug-359"></a>
Edebug is a source level debugger.  Edebug normally displays the
source of the code you are debugging, with an arrow at the left that
shows which line you are currently executing.

   <p>You can walk through the execution of a function, line by line, or run
quickly until reaching a <dfn>breakpoint</dfn> where execution stops.

   <p>Edebug is described in <a href="../elisp/Edebug.html#Edebug">Edebug</a>.

   <p>Here is a bugged function definition for <code>triangle-recursively</code>. 
See <a href="Recursive-triangle-function.html#Recursive-triangle-function">Recursion in place of a counter</a>,
for a review of it.

<pre class="smallexample">     (defun triangle-recursively-bugged (number)
       "Return sum of numbers 1 through NUMBER inclusive.
     Uses recursion."
       (if (= number 1)
           1
         (+ number
            (triangle-recursively-bugged
             (1= number)))))               ; <span class="roman">Error here.</span>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Normally, you would install this definition by positioning your cursor
after the function's closing parenthesis and typing <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>
(<code>eval-last-sexp</code>) or else by positioning your cursor within the
definition and typing <kbd>C-M-x</kbd> (<code>eval-defun</code>).  (By default,
the <code>eval-defun</code> command works only in Emacs Lisp mode or in Lisp
Interaction mode.)

   <p>However, to prepare this function definition for Edebug, you must
first <dfn>instrument</dfn> the code using a different command.  You can do
this by positioning your cursor within or just after the definition
and typing

<pre class="smallexample">     M-x edebug-defun &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This will cause Emacs to load Edebug automatically if it is not
already loaded, and properly instrument the function.

   <p>After instrumenting the function, place your cursor after the
following expression and type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd> (<code>eval-last-sexp</code>):

<pre class="smallexample">     (triangle-recursively-bugged 3)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You will be jumped back to the source for
<code>triangle-recursively-bugged</code> and the cursor positioned at the
beginning of the <code>if</code> line of the function.  Also, you will see
an arrowhead at the left hand side of that line.  The arrowhead marks
the line where the function is executing.  (In the following examples,
we show the arrowhead with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;; in a windowing system, you may
see the arrowhead as a solid triangle in the window fringe.)

<pre class="smallexample">     =&gt;-!-(if (= number 1)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In the example, the location of point is displayed as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-!-</span></samp>&rsquo;
(in a printed book, it is displayed with a five pointed star).

   <p>If you now press &lt;SPC&gt;, point will move to the next expression to
be executed; the line will look like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     =&gt;(if -!-(= number 1)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">As you continue to press &lt;SPC&gt;, point will move from expression to
expression.  At the same time, whenever an expression returns a value,
that value will be displayed in the echo area.  For example, after you
move point past <code>number</code>, you will see the following:

<pre class="smallexample">     Result: 3 (#o3, #x3, ?\C-c)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This means the value of <code>number</code> is 3, which is octal three,
hexadecimal three, and <span class="sc">ascii</span> Control-C (the third letter of the
alphabet, in case you need to know this information).

   <p>You can continue moving through the code until you reach the line with
the error.  Before evaluation, that line looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     =&gt;        -!-(1= number)))))               ; <span class="roman">Error here.</span>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When you press &lt;SPC&gt; once again, you will produce an error message
that says:

<pre class="smallexample">     Symbol's function definition is void: 1=
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This is the bug.

   <p>Press <kbd>q</kbd> to quit Edebug.

   <p>To remove instrumentation from a function definition, simply
re-evaluate it with a command that does not instrument it. 
For example, you could place your cursor after the definition's
closing parenthesis and type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>.

   <p>Edebug does a great deal more than walk with you through a function. 
You can set it so it races through on its own, stopping only at an
error or at specified stopping points; you can cause it to display the
changing values of various expressions; you can find out how many
times a function is called, and more.

   <p>Edebug is described in <a href="../elisp/Edebug.html#Edebug">Edebug</a>.
