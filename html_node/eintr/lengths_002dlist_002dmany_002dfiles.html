<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Determine the lengths of <code>defuns</code></h4>

   <p>The design using a <code>while</code> loop is routine.  The argument passed
to the function is a list of files.  As we saw earlier (see <a href="Loop-Example.html#Loop-Example">Loop Example</a>), you can write a <code>while</code> loop so that the body of the
loop is evaluated if such a list contains elements, but to exit the
loop if the list is empty.  For this design to work, the body of the
loop must contain an expression that shortens the list each time the
body is evaluated, so that eventually the list is empty.  The usual
technique is to set the value of the list to the value of the <span class="sc">cdr</span>
of the list each time the body is evaluated.

   <p>The template looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (while <var>test-whether-list-is-empty</var>
       <var>body</var>...
       <var>set-list-to-cdr-of-list</var>)
</pre>
   <p>Also, we remember that a <code>while</code> loop returns <code>nil</code> (the
result of evaluating the true-or-false-test), not the result of any
evaluation within its body.  (The evaluations within the body of the
loop are done for their side effects.)  However, the expression that
sets the lengths' list is part of the body&mdash;and that is the value
that we want returned by the function as a whole.  To do this, we
enclose the <code>while</code> loop within a <code>let</code> expression, and
arrange that the last element of the <code>let</code> expression contains
the value of the lengths' list.  (See <a href="Incrementing-Example.html#Incrementing-Example">Loop Example with an Incrementing Counter</a>.)

   <p><a name="index-lengths_002dlist_002dmany_002dfiles-286"></a>These considerations lead us directly to the function itself:

<pre class="smallexample">     ;;; <span class="roman">Use </span><code>while</code><span class="roman"> loop.</span>
     (defun lengths-list-many-files (list-of-files)
       "Return list of lengths of defuns in LIST-OF-FILES."
       (let (lengths-list)
     
     ;;; <span class="roman">true-or-false-test</span>
         (while list-of-files
           (setq lengths-list
                 (append
                  lengths-list
     
     ;;; <span class="roman">Generate a lengths' list.</span>
                  (lengths-list-file
                   (expand-file-name (car list-of-files)))))
     
     ;;; <span class="roman">Make files' list shorter.</span>
           (setq list-of-files (cdr list-of-files)))
     
     ;;; <span class="roman">Return final value of lengths' list.</span>
         lengths-list))
</pre>
   <p><code>expand-file-name</code> is a built-in function that converts a file
name to the absolute, long, path name form.  The function employs the
name of the directory in which the function is called.

<!-- !!! 22.1.1 lisp sources location here -->
   <p>Thus, if <code>expand-file-name</code> is called on <code>debug.el</code> when
Emacs is visiting the
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/share/emacs/22.1.1/lisp/emacs-lisp/</span></samp> directory,

<pre class="smallexample">     debug.el
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">becomes

<!-- !!! 22.1.1 lisp sources location here -->
<pre class="smallexample">     /usr/local/share/emacs/22.1.1/lisp/emacs-lisp/debug.el
</pre>
   <p>The only other new element of this function definition is the as yet
unstudied function <code>append</code>, which merits a short section for
itself.
