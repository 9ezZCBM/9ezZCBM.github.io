<p><a name="index-if-123"></a><a name="index-Conditional-with-_0040code_007bif_007d-124"></a>
A third special form, in addition to <code>defun</code> and <code>let</code>, is the
conditional <code>if</code>.  This form is used to instruct the computer to
make decisions.  You can write function definitions without using
<code>if</code>, but it is used often enough, and is important enough, to be
included here.  It is used, for example, in the code for the
function <code>beginning-of-buffer</code>.

   <p>The basic idea behind an <code>if</code>, is that <em>if</em> a test is true,
<em>then</em> an expression is evaluated.  If the test is not true, the
expression is not evaluated.  For example, you might make a decision
such as, &ldquo;if it is warm and sunny, then go to the beach!&rdquo;
