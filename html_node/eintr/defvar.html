<h3 class="section">8.5 Initializing a Variable with <code>defvar</code></h3>

<p><a name="index-defvar-210"></a><a name="index-Initializing-a-variable-211"></a><a name="index-Variable-initialization-212"></a>

   <p>The <code>copy-region-as-kill</code> function is written in Emacs Lisp.  Two
functions within it, <code>kill-append</code> and <code>kill-new</code>, copy a
region in a buffer and save it in a variable called the
<code>kill-ring</code>.  This section describes how the <code>kill-ring</code>
variable is created and initialized using the <code>defvar</code> special
form.

   <p>(Again we note that the term <code>kill-ring</code> is a misnomer.  The text
that is clipped out of the buffer can be brought back; it is not a ring
of corpses, but a ring of resurrectable text.)

   <p>In Emacs Lisp, a variable such as the <code>kill-ring</code> is created and
given an initial value by using the <code>defvar</code> special form.  The
name comes from &ldquo;define variable&rdquo;.

   <p>The <code>defvar</code> special form is similar to <code>setq</code> in that it sets
the value of a variable.  It is unlike <code>setq</code> in two ways: first,
it only sets the value of the variable if the variable does not already
have a value.  If the variable already has a value, <code>defvar</code> does
not override the existing value.  Second, <code>defvar</code> has a
documentation string.

   <p>(There is a related macro, <code>defcustom</code>, designed for variables
that people customize.  It has more features than <code>defvar</code>. 
(See <a href="defcustom.html#defcustom">Setting Variables with <code>defcustom</code></a>.)
