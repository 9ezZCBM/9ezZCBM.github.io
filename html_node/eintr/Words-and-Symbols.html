<h3 class="section">14.1 What to Count?</h3>

<p><a name="index-Words-and-symbols-in-defun-280"></a>
When we first start thinking about how to count the words in a
function definition, the first question is (or ought to be) what are
we going to count?  When we speak of &ldquo;words&rdquo; with respect to a Lisp
function definition, we are actually speaking, in large part, of
symbols.  For example, the following <code>multiply-by-seven</code>
function contains the five symbols <code>defun</code>,
<code>multiply-by-seven</code>, <code>number</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>7</code>.  In
addition, in the documentation string, it contains the four words
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Multiply</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">NUMBER</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">by</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">seven</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The
symbol &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">number</span></samp>&rsquo; is repeated, so the definition contains a total
of ten words and symbols.

<pre class="smallexample">     (defun multiply-by-seven (number)
       "Multiply NUMBER by seven."
       (* 7 number))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">However, if we mark the <code>multiply-by-seven</code> definition with
<kbd>C-M-h</kbd> (<code>mark-defun</code>), and then call
<code>count-words-example</code> on it, we will find that
<code>count-words-example</code> claims the definition has eleven words, not
ten!  Something is wrong!

   <p>The problem is twofold: <code>count-words-example</code> does not count the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; as a word, and it counts the single symbol,
<code>multiply-by-seven</code>, as containing three words.  The hyphens are
treated as if they were interword spaces rather than intraword
connectors: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">multiply-by-seven</span></samp>&rsquo; is counted as if it were written
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">multiply by seven</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The cause of this confusion is the regular expression search within
the <code>count-words-example</code> definition that moves point forward word
by word.  In the canonical version of <code>count-words-example</code>, the
regexp is:

<pre class="smallexample">     "\\w+\\W*"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This regular expression is a pattern defining one or more word
constituent characters possibly followed by one or more characters
that are not word constituents.  What is meant by &ldquo;word constituent
characters&rdquo; brings us to the issue of syntax, which is worth a section
of its own.
