<h3 class="section">6.2 <code>what-line</code></h3>

<p><a name="index-what_002dline-171"></a><a name="index-Widening_002c-example-of-172"></a>
The <code>what-line</code> command tells you the number of the line in which
the cursor is located.  The function illustrates the use of the
<code>save-restriction</code> and <code>save-excursion</code> commands.  Here is the
original text of the function:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defun what-line ()
       "Print the current line number (in the buffer) of point."
       (interactive)
       (save-restriction
         (widen)
         (save-excursion
           (beginning-of-line)
           (message "Line %d"
                    (1+ (count-lines 1 (point)))))))
</pre>
   <p>(In recent versions of GNU Emacs, the <code>what-line</code> function has
been expanded to tell you your line number in a narrowed buffer as
well as your line number in a widened buffer.  The recent version is
more complex than the version shown here.  If you feel adventurous,
you might want to look at it after figuring out how this version
works.  You will probably need to use <kbd>C-h f</kbd>
(<code>describe-function</code>).  The newer version uses a conditional to
determine whether the buffer has been narrowed.

   <p>(Also, it uses <code>line-number-at-pos</code>, which among other simple
expressions, such as <code>(goto-char (point-min))</code>, moves point to
the beginning of the current line with <code>(forward-line 0)</code> rather
than <code>beginning-of-line</code>.)

   <p>The <code>what-line</code> function as shown here has a documentation line
and is interactive, as you would expect.  The next two lines use the
functions <code>save-restriction</code> and <code>widen</code>.

   <p>The <code>save-restriction</code> special form notes whatever narrowing is in
effect, if any, in the current buffer and restores that narrowing after
the code in the body of the <code>save-restriction</code> has been evaluated.

   <p>The <code>save-restriction</code> special form is followed by <code>widen</code>. 
This function undoes any narrowing the current buffer may have had
when <code>what-line</code> was called.  (The narrowing that was there is
the narrowing that <code>save-restriction</code> remembers.)  This widening
makes it possible for the line counting commands to count from the
beginning of the buffer.  Otherwise, they would have been limited to
counting within the accessible region.  Any original narrowing is
restored just before the completion of the function by the
<code>save-restriction</code> special form.

   <p>The call to <code>widen</code> is followed by <code>save-excursion</code>, which
saves the location of the cursor (i.e., of point), and
restores it after the code in the body of the <code>save-excursion</code>
uses the <code>beginning-of-line</code> function to move point.

   <p>(Note that the <code>(widen)</code> expression comes between the
<code>save-restriction</code> and <code>save-excursion</code> special forms.  When
you write the two <code>save- ...</code> expressions in sequence, write
<code>save-excursion</code> outermost.)

   <p>The last two lines of the <code>what-line</code> function are functions to
count the number of lines in the buffer and then print the number in the
echo area.

<pre class="smallexample">     (message "Line %d"
              (1+ (count-lines 1 (point)))))))
</pre>
   <p>The <code>message</code> function prints a one-line message at the bottom of
the Emacs screen.  The first argument is inside of quotation marks and
is printed as a string of characters.  However, it may contain a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>&rsquo; expression to print a following argument.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>&rsquo; prints
the argument as a decimal, so the message will say something such as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Line 243</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The number that is printed in place of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>&rsquo; is computed by the
last line of the function:

<pre class="smallexample">     (1+ (count-lines 1 (point)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">What this does is count the lines from the first position of the
buffer, indicated by the <code>1</code>, up to <code>(point)</code>, and then add
one to that number.  (The <code>1+</code> function adds one to its
argument.)  We add one to it because line 2 has only one line before
it, and <code>count-lines</code> counts only the lines <em>before</em> the
current line.

   <p>After <code>count-lines</code> has done its job, and the message has been
printed in the echo area, the <code>save-excursion</code> restores point to
its original position; and <code>save-restriction</code> restores
the original narrowing, if any.
