<h4 class="appendixsubsec">C.4.4 The <code>mapcar</code> Function</h4>

<p><a name="index-mapcar-403"></a>
<code>mapcar</code> is a function that calls its first argument with each
element of its second argument, in turn.  The second argument must be
a sequence.

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">map</span></samp>&rsquo; part of the name comes from the mathematical phrase,
&ldquo;mapping over a domain&rdquo;, meaning to apply a function to each of the
elements in a domain.  The mathematical phrase is based on the
metaphor of a surveyor walking, one step at a time, over an area he is
mapping.  And &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">car</span></samp>&rsquo;, of course, comes from the Lisp notion of the
first of a list.

<p class="noindent">For example,

<pre class="smallexample">     (mapcar '1+ '(2 4 6))
          &rArr; (3 5 7)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The function <code>1+</code> which adds one to its argument, is executed on
<em>each</em> element of the list, and a new list is returned.

   <p>Contrast this with <code>apply</code>, which applies its first argument to
all the remaining. 
(See <a href="Readying-a-Graph.html#Readying-a-Graph">Readying a Graph</a>, for an explanation of
<code>apply</code>.)

   <p>In the definition of <code>one-fiftieth</code>, the first argument is the
anonymous function:

<pre class="smallexample">     (lambda (arg) (/ arg 50))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and the second argument is <code>full-range</code>, which will be bound to
<code>list-for-graph</code>.

   <p>The whole expression looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (mapcar (lambda (arg) (/ arg 50)) full-range))
</pre>
   <p>See <a href="../elisp/Mapping-Functions.html#Mapping-Functions">Mapping Functions</a>, for more about <code>mapcar</code>.

   <p>Using the <code>one-fiftieth</code> function, we can generate a list in
which each element is one-fiftieth the size of the corresponding
element in <code>list-for-graph</code>.

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq fiftieth-list-for-graph
           (one-fiftieth list-for-graph))
</pre>
   <p>The resulting list looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (10 20 19 15 11 9 6 5 4 3 3 2 2
     1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This, we are almost ready to print!  (We also notice the loss of
information: many of the higher ranges are 0, meaning that fewer than
50 defuns had that many words or symbols&mdash;but not necessarily meaning
that none had that many words or symbols.)
