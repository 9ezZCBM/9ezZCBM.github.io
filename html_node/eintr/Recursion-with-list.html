<h4 class="subsection">11.3.3 Recursion with a List</h4>

<p>The example of a <code>while</code> loop that printed the elements of a list
of numbers can be written recursively.  Here is the code, including
an expression to set the value of the variable <code>animals</code> to a list.

   <p>If you are reading this in Info in Emacs, you can evaluate this
expression directly in Info.  Otherwise, you must copy the example
to the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer and evaluate each expression there. 
Use <kbd>C-u C-x C-e</kbd> to evaluate the
<code>(print-elements-recursively animals)</code> expression so that the
results are printed in the buffer; otherwise the Lisp interpreter will
try to squeeze the results into the one line of the echo area.

   <p>Also, place your cursor immediately after the last closing parenthesis
of the <code>print-elements-recursively</code> function, before the comment. 
Otherwise, the Lisp interpreter will try to evaluate the comment.

   <p><a name="index-print_002delements_002drecursively-241"></a>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq animals '(gazelle giraffe lion tiger))
     
     (defun print-elements-recursively (list)
       "Print each element of LIST on a line of its own.
     Uses recursion."
       (when list                            ; <span class="roman">do-again-test</span>
             (print (car list))              ; <span class="roman">body</span>
             (print-elements-recursively     ; <span class="roman">recursive call</span>
              (cdr list))))                  ; <span class="roman">next-step-expression</span>
     
     (print-elements-recursively animals)
</pre>
   <p>The <code>print-elements-recursively</code> function first tests whether
there is any content in the list; if there is, the function prints the
first element of the list, the <span class="sc">car</span> of the list.  Then the
function invokes itself, but gives itself as its argument, not the
whole list, but the second and subsequent elements of the list, the
<span class="sc">cdr</span> of the list.

   <p>Put another way, if the list is not empty, the function invokes
another instance of code that is similar to the initial code, but is a
different thread of execution, with different arguments than the first
instance.

   <p>Put in yet another way, if the list is not empty, the first robot
assembles a second robot and tells it what to do; the second robot is
a different individual from the first, but is the same model.

   <p>When the second evaluation occurs, the <code>when</code> expression is
evaluated and if true, prints the first element of the list it
receives as its argument (which is the second element of the original
list).  Then the function calls itself with the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the list
it is invoked with, which (the second time around) is the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of
the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the original list.

   <p>Note that although we say that the function &ldquo;calls itself&rdquo;, what we
mean is that the Lisp interpreter assembles and instructs a new
instance of the program.  The new instance is a clone of the first,
but is a separate individual.

   <p>Each time the function invokes itself, it does so on a
shorter version of the original list.  It creates a new instance that
works on a shorter list.

   <p>Eventually, the function invokes itself on an empty list.  It creates
a new instance whose argument is <code>nil</code>.  The conditional expression
tests the value of <code>list</code>.  Since the value of <code>list</code> is
<code>nil</code>, the <code>when</code> expression tests false so the then-part is
not evaluated.  The function as a whole then returns <code>nil</code>.

   <p>When you evaluate the expression <code>(print-elements-recursively
animals)</code> in the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer, you see this result:

<pre class="smallexample">     gazelle
     
     giraffe
     
     lion
     
     tiger
     nil
</pre>
   </body></html>
