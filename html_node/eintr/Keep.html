<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">Recursive Pattern: <em>keep</em></h5>

<p><a name="index-Keep_002c-type-of-recursive-pattern-249"></a><a name="index-Recursive-pattern-_002d-keep-250"></a>
A third recursive pattern is called the <code>keep</code> pattern. 
In the <code>keep</code> recursive pattern, each element of a list is tested;
the element is acted on and the results are kept only if the element
meets a criterion.

   <p>Again, this is very like the <code>every</code> pattern, except the element is
skipped unless it meets a criterion.

   <p>The pattern has three parts:

     <ul>
<li>If a list be empty, return <code>nil</code>. 
<li>Else, if the beginning of the list (the <span class="sc">car</span> of the list) passes
        a test
          <ul>
    <li>    act on that element and combine it, using <code>cons</code> with
    <li>    a recursive call by the function on the rest (the <span class="sc">cdr</span>) of the list. 
    </ul>
     <li>Otherwise, if the beginning of the list (the <span class="sc">car</span> of the list) fails
the test
          <ul>
    <li>    skip on that element,
    <li>    and, recursively call the function on the rest (the <span class="sc">cdr</span>) of the list. 
    </ul>
     </ul>

   <p>Here is an example that uses <code>cond</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defun keep-three-letter-words (word-list)
       "Keep three letter words in WORD-LIST."
       (cond
        ;; First do-again-test: stop-condition
        ((not word-list) nil)
     
        ;; Second do-again-test: when to act
        ((eq 3 (length (symbol-name (car word-list))))
         ;; combine acted-on element with recursive call on shorter list
         (cons (car word-list) (keep-three-letter-words (cdr word-list))))
     
        ;; Third do-again-test: when to skip element;
        ;;   recursively call shorter list with next-step expression
        (t (keep-three-letter-words (cdr word-list)))))
     
     (keep-three-letter-words '(one two three four five six))
         &rArr; (one two six)
</pre>
   <p>It goes without saying that you need not use <code>nil</code> as the test for
when to stop; and you can, of course, combine these patterns.
