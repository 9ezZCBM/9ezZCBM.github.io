<h4 class="subsection">4.4.1 The <code>append-to-buffer</code> Interactive Expression</h4>

<p>Since the <code>append-to-buffer</code> function will be used interactively,
the function must have an <code>interactive</code> expression.  (For a
review of <code>interactive</code>, see <a href="Interactive.html#Interactive">Making a Function Interactive</a>.)  The expression reads as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     (interactive
      (list (read-buffer
             "Append to buffer: "
             (other-buffer (current-buffer) t))
            (region-beginning)
            (region-end)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This expression is not one with letters standing for parts, as
described earlier.  Instead, it starts a list with these parts:

   <p>The first part of the list is an expression to read the name of a
buffer and return it as a string.  That is <code>read-buffer</code>.  The
function requires a prompt as its first argument, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"Append to
buffer: "</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Its second argument tells the command what value to
provide if you don't specify anything.

   <p>In this case that second argument is an expression containing the
function <code>other-buffer</code>, an exception, and a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>&rsquo;, standing
for true.

   <p>The first argument to <code>other-buffer</code>, the exception, is yet
another function, <code>current-buffer</code>.  That is not going to be
returned.  The second argument is the symbol for true, <code>t</code>. that
tells <code>other-buffer</code> that it may show visible buffers (except in
this case, it will not show the current buffer, which makes sense).

   <p>The expression looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (other-buffer (current-buffer) t)
</pre>
   <p>The second and third arguments to the <code>list</code> expression are
<code>(region-beginning)</code> and <code>(region-end)</code>.  These two
functions specify the beginning and end of the text to be appended.

   <p>Originally, the command used the letters &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
The whole <code>interactive</code> expression looked like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (interactive "BAppend to buffer: \nr")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">But when that was done, the default value of the buffer switched to
was invisible.  That was not wanted.

   <p>(The prompt was separated from the second argument with a newline,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\n</span></samp>&rsquo;.  It was followed by an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>&rsquo; that told Emacs to bind the
two arguments that follow the symbol <code>buffer</code> in the function's
argument list (that is, <code>start</code> and <code>end</code>) to the values of
point and mark.  That argument worked fine.)
