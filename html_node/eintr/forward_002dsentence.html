<p><a name="index-forward_002dsentence-263"></a>
The command to move the cursor forward a sentence is a straightforward
illustration of how to use regular expression searches in Emacs Lisp. 
Indeed, the function looks longer and more complicated than it is; this
is because the function is designed to go backwards as well as forwards;
and, optionally, over more than one sentence.  The function is usually
bound to the key command <kbd>M-e</kbd>.
