<h4 class="subsection">5.2.5 The <code>let</code> Expression in <code>insert-buffer</code></h4>

<p>After ensuring that the variable <code>buffer</code> refers to a buffer itself
and not just to the name of a buffer, the <code>insert-buffer function</code>
continues with a <code>let</code> expression.  This specifies three local
variables, <code>start</code>, <code>end</code>, and <code>newmark</code> and binds them
to the initial value <code>nil</code>.  These variables are used inside the
remainder of the <code>let</code> and temporarily hide any other occurrence of
variables of the same name in Emacs until the end of the <code>let</code>.

   <p>The body of the <code>let</code> contains two <code>save-excursion</code>
expressions.  First, we will look at the inner <code>save-excursion</code>
expression in detail.  The expression looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (save-excursion
       (set-buffer buffer)
       (setq start (point-min) end (point-max)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The expression <code>(set-buffer buffer)</code> changes Emacs's attention
from the current buffer to the one from which the text will copied. 
In that buffer, the variables <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> are set to
the beginning and end of the buffer, using the commands
<code>point-min</code> and <code>point-max</code>.  Note that we have here an
illustration of how <code>setq</code> is able to set two variables in the
same expression.  The first argument of <code>setq</code> is set to the
value of its second, and its third argument is set to the value of its
fourth.

   <p>After the body of the inner <code>save-excursion</code> is evaluated, the
<code>save-excursion</code> restores the original buffer, but <code>start</code> and
<code>end</code> remain set to the values of the beginning and end of the
buffer from which the text will be copied.

   <p>The outer <code>save-excursion</code> expression looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (save-excursion
       (<var>inner-</var><code>save-excursion</code><var>-expression</var>
          (<var>go-to-new-buffer-and-set-</var><code>start</code><var>-and-</var><code>end</code>)
       (insert-buffer-substring buffer start end)
       (setq newmark (point)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <code>insert-buffer-substring</code> function copies the text
<em>into</em> the current buffer <em>from</em> the region indicated by
<code>start</code> and <code>end</code> in <code>buffer</code>.  Since the whole of the
second buffer lies between <code>start</code> and <code>end</code>, the whole of
the second buffer is copied into the buffer you are editing.  Next,
the value of point, which will be at the end of the inserted text, is
recorded in the variable <code>newmark</code>.

   <p>After the body of the outer <code>save-excursion</code> is evaluated, point
is relocated to its original place.

   <p>However, it is convenient to locate a mark at the end of the newly
inserted text and locate point at its beginning.  The <code>newmark</code>
variable records the end of the inserted text.  In the last line of
the <code>let</code> expression, the <code>(push-mark newmark)</code> expression
function sets a mark to this location.  (The previous location of the
mark is still accessible; it is recorded on the mark ring and you can
go back to it with <kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>.)  Meanwhile, point is
located at the beginning of the inserted text, which is where it was
before you called the insert function, the position of which was saved
by the first <code>save-excursion</code>.

   <p>The whole <code>let</code> expression looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (let (start end newmark)
       (save-excursion
         (save-excursion
           (set-buffer buffer)
           (setq start (point-min) end (point-max)))
         (insert-buffer-substring buffer start end)
         (setq newmark (point)))
       (push-mark newmark))
</pre>
   <p>Like the <code>append-to-buffer</code> function, the <code>insert-buffer</code>
function uses <code>let</code>, <code>save-excursion</code>, and
<code>set-buffer</code>.  In addition, the function illustrates one way to
use <code>or</code>.  All these functions are building blocks that we will
find and use again and again.
