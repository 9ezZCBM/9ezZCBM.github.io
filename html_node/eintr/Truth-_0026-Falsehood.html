<h3 class="section">3.9 Truth and Falsehood in Emacs Lisp</h3>

<p><a name="index-Truth-and-falsehood-in-Emacs-Lisp-129"></a><a name="index-Falsehood-and-truth-in-Emacs-Lisp-130"></a><a name="index-nil-131"></a>
There is an important aspect to the truth test in an <code>if</code>
expression.  So far, we have spoken of &ldquo;true&rdquo; and &ldquo;false&rdquo; as values of
predicates as if they were new kinds of Emacs Lisp objects.  In fact,
&ldquo;false&rdquo; is just our old friend <code>nil</code>.  Anything else&mdash;anything
at all&mdash;is &ldquo;true&rdquo;.

   <p>The expression that tests for truth is interpreted as <dfn>true</dfn>
if the result of evaluating it is a value that is not <code>nil</code>.  In
other words, the result of the test is considered true if the value
returned is a number such as 47, a string such as <code>"hello"</code>, or a
symbol (other than <code>nil</code>) such as <code>flowers</code>, or a list (so
long as it is not empty), or even a buffer!

<ul class="menu">
<li><a accesskey="1" href="nil-explained.html#nil-explained">nil explained</a>:                <code>nil</code> has two meanings. 
</ul>
