<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">Putting the function definition together</h5>

<p>We can put these expressions together to create a function definition
that works.  However, on examination, we find that one of the local
variables is unneeded!

   <p>The function definition looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     ;;; <span class="roman">First subtractive version.</span>
     (defun triangle (number-of-rows)
       "Add up the number of pebbles in a triangle."
       (let ((total 0)
             (number-of-pebbles-in-row number-of-rows))
         (while (&gt; number-of-pebbles-in-row 0)
           (setq total (+ total number-of-pebbles-in-row))
           (setq number-of-pebbles-in-row
                 (1- number-of-pebbles-in-row)))
         total))
</pre>
   <p>As written, this function works.

   <p>However, we do not need <code>number-of-pebbles-in-row</code>.

   <p><a name="index-Argument-as-local-variable-233"></a>When the <code>triangle</code> function is evaluated, the symbol
<code>number-of-rows</code> will be bound to a number, giving it an initial
value.  That number can be changed in the body of the function as if
it were a local variable, without any fear that such a change will
effect the value of the variable outside of the function.  This is a
very useful characteristic of Lisp; it means that the variable
<code>number-of-rows</code> can be used anywhere in the function where
<code>number-of-pebbles-in-row</code> is used.

   <p>Here is a second version of the function written a bit more cleanly:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defun triangle (number)                ; <span class="roman">Second version.</span>
       "Return sum of numbers 1 through NUMBER inclusive."
       (let ((total 0))
         (while (&gt; number 0)
           (setq total (+ total number))
           (setq number (1- number)))
         total))
</pre>
   <p>In brief, a properly written <code>while</code> loop will consist of three parts:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>A test that will return false after the loop has repeated itself the
correct number of times.

     <li>An expression the evaluation of which will return the value desired
after being repeatedly evaluated.

     <li>An expression to change the value passed to the true-or-false-test so
that the test returns false after the loop has repeated itself the right
number of times.
        </ol>
