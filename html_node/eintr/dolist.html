<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">The <code>dolist</code> Macro</h4>

<p><a name="index-dolist-234"></a>
Suppose, for example, you want to reverse a list, so that
&ldquo;first&rdquo; &ldquo;second&rdquo; &ldquo;third&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;third&rdquo; &ldquo;second&rdquo; &ldquo;first&rdquo;.

   <p>In practice, you would use the <code>reverse</code> function, like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq animals '(gazelle giraffe lion tiger))
     
     (reverse animals)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here is how you could reverse the list using a <code>while</code> loop:

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq animals '(gazelle giraffe lion tiger))
     
     (defun reverse-list-with-while (list)
       "Using while, reverse the order of LIST."
       (let (value)  ; make sure list starts empty
         (while list
           (setq value (cons (car list) value))
           (setq list (cdr list)))
         value))
     
     (reverse-list-with-while animals)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">And here is how you could use the <code>dolist</code> macro:

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq animals '(gazelle giraffe lion tiger))
     
     (defun reverse-list-with-dolist (list)
       "Using dolist, reverse the order of LIST."
       (let (value)  ; make sure list starts empty
         (dolist (element list value)
           (setq value (cons element value)))))
     
     (reverse-list-with-dolist animals)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In Info, you can place your cursor after the closing parenthesis of
each expression and type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>; in each case, you should see

<pre class="smallexample">     (tiger lion giraffe gazelle)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">in the echo area.

   <p>For this example, the existing <code>reverse</code> function is obviously best. 
The <code>while</code> loop is just like our first example (see <a href="Loop-Example.html#Loop-Example">A <code>while</code> Loop and a List</a>).  The <code>while</code> first
checks whether the list has elements; if so, it constructs a new list
by adding the first element of the list to the existing list (which in
the first iteration of the loop is <code>nil</code>).  Since the second
element is prepended in front of the first element, and the third
element is prepended in front of the second element, the list is reversed.

   <p>In the expression using a <code>while</code> loop,
the <code>(setq&nbsp;list&nbsp;(cdr&nbsp;list))</code><!-- /@w -->
expression shortens the list, so the <code>while</code> loop eventually
stops.  In addition, it provides the <code>cons</code> expression with a new
first element by creating a new and shorter list at each repetition of
the loop.

   <p>The <code>dolist</code> expression does very much the same as the
<code>while</code> expression, except that the <code>dolist</code> macro does some
of the work you have to do when writing a <code>while</code> expression.

   <p>Like a <code>while</code> loop, a <code>dolist</code> loops.  What is different is
that it automatically shortens the list each time it loops&mdash;it
<span class="sc">cdr</span>s down the list on its own&mdash;and it automatically binds
the <span class="sc">car</span> of each shorter version of the list to the first of its
arguments.

   <p>In the example, the <span class="sc">car</span> of each shorter version of the list is
referred to using the symbol &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">element</span></samp>&rsquo;, the list itself is called
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">list</span></samp>&rsquo;, and the value returned is called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">value</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The
remainder of the <code>dolist</code> expression is the body.

   <p>The <code>dolist</code> expression binds the <span class="sc">car</span> of each shorter
version of the list to <code>element</code> and then evaluates the body of
the expression; and repeats the loop.  The result is returned in
<code>value</code>.
