<h3 class="section">1.2 Run a Program</h3>

<p><a name="index-Run-a-program-16"></a><a name="index-Program_002c-running-one-17"></a>
<a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bevaluate_007d-defined-18"></a>A list in Lisp&mdash;any list&mdash;is a program ready to run.  If you run it
(for which the Lisp jargon is <dfn>evaluate</dfn>), the computer will do one
of three things: do nothing except return to you the list itself; send
you an error message; or, treat the first symbol in the list as a
command to do something.  (Usually, of course, it is the last of these
three things that you really want!)

<!-- use code for the single apostrophe, not samp. -->
   <p><a name="index-quote-19"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_0027_007d-for-quoting-20"></a><a name="index-quoting-using-apostrophe-21"></a><a name="index-apostrophe-for-quoting-22"></a>The single apostrophe, <code>'</code>, that I put in front of some of the
example lists in preceding sections is called a <dfn>quote</dfn>; when it
precedes a list, it tells Lisp to do nothing with the list, other than
take it as it is written.  But if there is no quote preceding a list,
the first item of the list is special: it is a command for the computer
to obey.  (In Lisp, these commands are called <em>functions</em>.)  The list
<code>(+ 2 2)</code> shown above did not have a quote in front of it, so Lisp
understands that the <code>+</code> is an instruction to do something with the
rest of the list: add the numbers that follow.

   <p>If you are reading this inside of GNU Emacs in Info, here is how you can
evaluate such a list:  place your cursor immediately after the right
hand parenthesis of the following list and then type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>:

<pre class="smallexample">     (+ 2 2)
</pre>
   <!-- use code for the number four, not samp. -->
<p class="noindent">You will see the number <code>4</code> appear in the echo area<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  (What you have just done is evaluate the list.  The echo area is
the line at the bottom of the screen that displays or echoes text.) 
Now try the same thing with a quoted list: place the cursor right
after the following list and type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>:

<pre class="smallexample">     '(this is a quoted list)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You will see <code>(this is a quoted list)</code> appear in the echo area.

   <p><a name="index-Lisp-interpreter_002c-explained-23"></a><a name="index-Interpreter_002c-Lisp_002c-explained-24"></a>In both cases, what you are doing is giving a command to the program
inside of GNU Emacs called the <dfn>Lisp interpreter</dfn>&mdash;giving the
interpreter a command to evaluate the expression.  The name of the Lisp
interpreter comes from the word for the task done by a human who comes
up with the meaning of an expression&mdash;who interprets it.

   <p>You can also evaluate an atom that is not part of a list&mdash;one that is
not surrounded by parentheses; again, the Lisp interpreter translates
from the humanly readable expression to the language of the computer. 
But before discussing this (see <a href="Variables.html#Variables">Variables</a>), we will discuss what the
Lisp interpreter does when you make an error.

Emacs shows integer values in decimal, in octal and in hex, and also
as a character, but let's ignore this convenience feature for now.
