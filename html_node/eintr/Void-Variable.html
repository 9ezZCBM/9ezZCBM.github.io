<h4 class="subsection">1.7.2 Error Message for a Symbol Without a Value</h4>

<p><a name="index-Symbol-without-value-error-45"></a><a name="index-Error-for-symbol-without-value-46"></a>
If you attempt to evaluate a symbol that does not have a value bound to
it, you will receive an error message.  You can see this by
experimenting with our 2 plus 2 addition.  In the following expression,
put your cursor right after the <code>+</code>, before the first number 2,
type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>:

<pre class="smallexample">     (+ 2 2)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In GNU Emacs 22, you will create a <samp><span class="file">*Backtrace*</span></samp> buffer that
says:

<pre class="smallexample">     ---------- Buffer: *Backtrace* ----------
     Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-variable +)
       eval(+)
       elisp--eval-last-sexp(nil)
       eval-last-sexp(nil)
       funcall-interactively(eval-last-sexp nil)
       call-interactively(eval-last-sexp nil nil)
       command-execute(eval-last-sexp)
     ---------- Buffer: *Backtrace* ----------
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(Again, you can quit the debugger by
typing <kbd>q</kbd> in the <samp><span class="file">*Backtrace*</span></samp> buffer.)

   <p>This backtrace is different from the very first error message we saw,
which said, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-function this)</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
In this case, the function does not have a value as a variable; while
in the other error message, the function (the word &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">this</span></samp>&rsquo;) did not
have a definition.

   <p>In this experiment with the <code>+</code>, what we did was cause the Lisp
interpreter to evaluate the <code>+</code> and look for the value of the
variable instead of the function definition.  We did this by placing the
cursor right after the symbol rather than after the parenthesis of the
enclosing list as we did before.  As a consequence, the Lisp interpreter
evaluated the preceding s-expression, which in this case was
<code>+</code> by itself.

   <p>Since <code>+</code> does not have a value bound to it, just the function
definition, the error message reported that the symbol's value as a
variable was void.
