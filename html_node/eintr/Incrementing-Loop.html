<h4 class="subsection">11.1.3 A Loop with an Incrementing Counter</h4>

<p>A loop is not useful unless it stops when it ought.  Besides
controlling a loop with a list, a common way of stopping a loop is to
write the first argument as a test that returns false when the correct
number of repetitions are complete.  This means that the loop must
have a counter&mdash;an expression that counts how many times the loop
repeats itself.
