<h3 class="section">9.1 Symbols as a Chest of Drawers</h3>

<p><a name="index-Symbols-as-a-Chest-of-Drawers-217"></a><a name="index-Chest-of-Drawers_002c-metaphor-for-a-symbol-218"></a><a name="index-Drawers_002c-Chest-of_002c-metaphor-for-a-symbol-219"></a>
In an earlier section, I suggested that you might imagine a symbol as
being a chest of drawers.  The function definition is put in one
drawer, the value in another, and so on.  What is put in the drawer
holding the value can be changed without affecting the contents of the
drawer holding the function definition, and vice versa.

   <p>Actually, what is put in each drawer is the address of the value or
function definition.  It is as if you found an old chest in the attic,
and in one of its drawers you found a map giving you directions to
where the buried treasure lies.

   <p>(In addition to its name, symbol definition, and variable value, a
symbol has a drawer for a <dfn>property list</dfn> which can be used to
record other information.  Property lists are not discussed here; see
<a href="../elisp/Property-Lists.html#Property-Lists">Property Lists</a>.)

   <p>Here is a fanciful representation:
