<h3 class="section">7.5 <code>setcar</code></h3>

<p><a name="index-setcar-180"></a>
As you might guess from their names, the <code>setcar</code> and <code>setcdr</code>
functions set the <span class="sc">car</span> or the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of a list to a new value. 
They actually change the original list, unlike <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code>
which leave the original list as it was.  One way to find out how this
works is to experiment.  We will start with the <code>setcar</code> function.

   <p>First, we can make a list and then set the value of a variable to the
list, using the <code>setq</code> function.  Here is a list of animals:

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq animals '(antelope giraffe lion tiger))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you are reading this in Info inside of GNU Emacs, you can evaluate
this expression in the usual fashion, by positioning the cursor after
the expression and typing <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>.  (I'm doing this right here
as I write this.  This is one of the advantages of having the
interpreter built into the computing environment.  Incidentally, when
there is nothing on the line after the final parentheses, such as a
comment, point can be on the next line.  Thus, if your cursor is in
the first column of the next line, you do not need to move it. 
Indeed, Emacs permits any amount of white space after the final
parenthesis.)

   <p>When we evaluate the variable <code>animals</code>, we see that it is bound to
the list <code>(antelope giraffe lion tiger)</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     animals
          &rArr; (antelope giraffe lion tiger)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Put another way, the variable <code>animals</code> points to the list
<code>(antelope giraffe lion tiger)</code>.

   <p>Next, evaluate the function <code>setcar</code> while passing it two
arguments, the variable <code>animals</code> and the quoted symbol
<code>hippopotamus</code>; this is done by writing the three element list
<code>(setcar animals 'hippopotamus)</code> and then evaluating it in the
usual fashion:

<pre class="smallexample">     (setcar animals 'hippopotamus)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">After evaluating this expression, evaluate the variable <code>animals</code>
again.  You will see that the list of animals has changed:

<pre class="smallexample">     animals
          &rArr; (hippopotamus giraffe lion tiger)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first element on the list, <code>antelope</code> is replaced by
<code>hippopotamus</code>.

   <p>So we can see that <code>setcar</code> did not add a new element to the list
as <code>cons</code> would have; it replaced <code>antelope</code> with
<code>hippopotamus</code>; it <em>changed</em> the list.
