<h4 class="subsection">1.9.1 Using <code>set</code></h4>

<p><a name="index-set-63"></a>
To set the value of the symbol <code>flowers</code> to the list <code>'(rose
violet daisy buttercup)</code>, evaluate the following expression by
positioning the cursor after the expression and typing <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>.

<pre class="smallexample">     (set 'flowers '(rose violet daisy buttercup))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The list <code>(rose violet daisy buttercup)</code> will appear in the echo
area.  This is what is <em>returned</em> by the <code>set</code> function.  As a
side effect, the symbol <code>flowers</code> is bound to the list; that is,
the symbol <code>flowers</code>, which can be viewed as a variable, is given
the list as its value.  (This process, by the way, illustrates how a
side effect to the Lisp interpreter, setting the value, can be the
primary effect that we humans are interested in.  This is because every
Lisp function must return a value if it does not get an error, but it
will only have a side effect if it is designed to have one.)

   <p>After evaluating the <code>set</code> expression, you can evaluate the symbol
<code>flowers</code> and it will return the value you just set.  Here is the
symbol.  Place your cursor after it and type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>.

<pre class="smallexample">     flowers
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When you evaluate <code>flowers</code>, the list
<code>(rose violet daisy buttercup)</code> appears in the echo area.

   <p>Incidentally, if you evaluate <code>'flowers</code>, the variable with a quote
in front of it, what you will see in the echo area is the symbol itself,
<code>flowers</code>.  Here is the quoted symbol, so you can try this:

<pre class="smallexample">     'flowers
</pre>
   <p>Note also, that when you use <code>set</code>, you need to quote both
arguments to <code>set</code>, unless you want them evaluated.  Since we do
not want either argument evaluated, neither the variable
<code>flowers</code> nor the list <code>(rose violet daisy buttercup)</code>, both
are quoted.  (When you use <code>set</code> without quoting its first
argument, the first argument is evaluated before anything else is
done.  If you did this and <code>flowers</code> did not have a value
already, you would get an error message that the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Symbol's value
as variable is void</span></samp>&rsquo;; on the other hand, if <code>flowers</code> did return
a value after it was evaluated, the <code>set</code> would attempt to set
the value that was returned.  There are situations where this is the
right thing for the function to do; but such situations are rare.)
