<h4 class="subsection">1.9.2 Using <code>setq</code></h4>

<p><a name="index-setq-64"></a>
As a practical matter, you almost always quote the first argument to
<code>set</code>.  The combination of <code>set</code> and a quoted first argument
is so common that it has its own name: the special form <code>setq</code>. 
This special form is just like <code>set</code> except that the first argument
is quoted automatically, so you don't need to type the quote mark
yourself.  Also, as an added convenience, <code>setq</code> permits you to set
several different variables to different values, all in one expression.

   <p>To set the value of the variable <code>carnivores</code> to the list
<code>'(lion tiger leopard)</code> using <code>setq</code>, the following expression
is used:

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq carnivores '(lion tiger leopard))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This is exactly the same as using <code>set</code> except the first argument
is automatically quoted by <code>setq</code>.  (The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">q</span></samp>&rsquo; in <code>setq</code>
means <code>quote</code>.)

   <p>With <code>set</code>, the expression would look like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (set 'carnivores '(lion tiger leopard))
</pre>
   <p>Also, <code>setq</code> can be used to assign different values to
different variables.  The first argument is bound to the value
of the second argument, the third argument is bound to the value of the
fourth argument, and so on.  For example, you could use the following to
assign a list of trees to the symbol <code>trees</code> and a list of herbivores
to the symbol <code>herbivores</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq trees '(pine fir oak maple)
           herbivores '(gazelle antelope zebra))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(The expression could just as well have been on one line, but it might
not have fit on a page; and humans find it easier to read nicely
formatted lists.)

   <p>Although I have been using the term &ldquo;assign&rdquo;, there is another way of
thinking about the workings of <code>set</code> and <code>setq</code>; and that is to
say that <code>set</code> and <code>setq</code> make the symbol <em>point</em> to the
list.  This latter way of thinking is very common and in forthcoming
chapters we shall come upon at least one symbol that has &ldquo;pointer&rdquo; as
part of its name.  The name is chosen because the symbol has a value,
specifically a list, attached to it; or, expressed another way,
the symbol is set to point to the list.
