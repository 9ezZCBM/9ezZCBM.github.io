<h4 class="subsection">11.1.1 A <code>while</code> Loop and a List</h4>

<p>A common way to control a <code>while</code> loop is to test whether a list
has any elements.  If it does, the loop is repeated; but if it does not,
the repetition is ended.  Since this is an important technique, we will
create a short example to illustrate it.

   <p>A simple way to test whether a list has elements is to evaluate the
list: if it has no elements, it is an empty list and will return the
empty list, <code>()</code>, which is a synonym for <code>nil</code> or false.  On
the other hand, a list with elements will return those elements when it
is evaluated.  Since Emacs Lisp considers as true any value that is not
<code>nil</code>, a list that returns elements will test true in a
<code>while</code> loop.

   <p>For example, you can set the variable <code>empty-list</code> to <code>nil</code> by
evaluating the following <code>setq</code> expression:

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq empty-list ())
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">After evaluating the <code>setq</code> expression, you can evaluate the
variable <code>empty-list</code> in the usual way, by placing the cursor after
the symbol and typing <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>; <code>nil</code> will appear in your
echo area:

<pre class="smallexample">     empty-list
</pre>
   <p>On the other hand, if you set a variable to be a list with elements, the
list will appear when you evaluate the variable, as you can see by
evaluating the following two expressions:

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq animals '(gazelle giraffe lion tiger))
     
     animals
</pre>
   <p>Thus, to create a <code>while</code> loop that tests whether there are any
items in the list <code>animals</code>, the first part of the loop will be
written like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (while animals
            ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When the <code>while</code> tests its first argument, the variable
<code>animals</code> is evaluated.  It returns a list.  So long as the list
has elements, the <code>while</code> considers the results of the test to be
true; but when the list is empty, it considers the results of the test
to be false.

   <p>To prevent the <code>while</code> loop from running forever, some mechanism
needs to be provided to empty the list eventually.  An oft-used
technique is to have one of the subsequent forms in the <code>while</code>
expression set the value of the list to be the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the list. 
Each time the <code>cdr</code> function is evaluated, the list will be made
shorter, until eventually only the empty list will be left.  At this
point, the test of the <code>while</code> loop will return false, and the
arguments to the <code>while</code> will no longer be evaluated.

   <p>For example, the list of animals bound to the variable <code>animals</code>
can be set to be the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the original list with the
following expression:

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq animals (cdr animals))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you have evaluated the previous expressions and then evaluate this
expression, you will see <code>(giraffe lion tiger)</code> appear in the echo
area.  If you evaluate the expression again, <code>(lion tiger)</code> will
appear in the echo area.  If you evaluate it again and yet again,
<code>(tiger)</code> appears and then the empty list, shown by <code>nil</code>.

   <p>A template for a <code>while</code> loop that uses the <code>cdr</code> function
repeatedly to cause the true-or-false-test eventually to test false
looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (while <var>test-whether-list-is-empty</var>
       <var>body</var>...
       <var>set-list-to-cdr-of-list</var>)
</pre>
   <p>This test and use of <code>cdr</code> can be put together in a function that
goes through a list and prints each element of the list on a line of its
own.
