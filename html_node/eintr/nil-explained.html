<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">An explanation of <code>nil</code></h4>

   <p>Before illustrating a test for truth, we need an explanation of <code>nil</code>.

   <p>In Emacs Lisp, the symbol <code>nil</code> has two meanings.  First, it means the
empty list.  Second, it means false and is the value returned when a
true-or-false-test tests false.  <code>nil</code> can be written as an empty
list, <code>()</code>, or as <code>nil</code>.  As far as the Lisp interpreter is
concerned, <code>()</code> and <code>nil</code> are the same.  Humans, however, tend
to use <code>nil</code> for false and <code>()</code> for the empty list.

   <p>In Emacs Lisp, any value that is not <code>nil</code>&mdash;is not the empty
list&mdash;is considered true.  This means that if an evaluation returns
something that is not an empty list, an <code>if</code> expression will test
true.  For example, if a number is put in the slot for the test, it
will be evaluated and will return itself, since that is what numbers
do when evaluated.  In this conditional, the <code>if</code> expression will
test true.  The expression tests false only when <code>nil</code>, an empty
list, is returned by evaluating the expression.

   <p>You can see this by evaluating the two expressions in the following examples.

   <p>In the first example, the number 4 is evaluated as the test in the
<code>if</code> expression and returns itself; consequently, the then-part
of the expression is evaluated and returned: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">true</span></samp>&rsquo; appears in
the echo area.  In the second example, the <code>nil</code> indicates false;
consequently, the else-part of the expression is evaluated and
returned: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">false</span></samp>&rsquo; appears in the echo area.

<pre class="smallexample">     (if 4
         'true
       'false)
     
     (if nil
         'true
       'false)
</pre>
   <p>Incidentally, if some other useful value is not available for a test that
returns true, then the Lisp interpreter will return the symbol <code>t</code>
for true.  For example, the expression <code>(&gt; 5 4)</code> returns <code>t</code>
when evaluated, as you can see by evaluating it in the usual way:

<pre class="smallexample">     (&gt; 5 4)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">On the other hand, this function returns <code>nil</code> if the test is false.

<pre class="smallexample">     (&gt; 4 5)
</pre>
   </body></html>
