<h3 class="section">16.9 Loading Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-Loading-files-337"></a><!-- findex load -->

   <p>Many people in the GNU Emacs community have written extensions to
Emacs.  As time goes by, these extensions are often included in new
releases.  For example, the Calendar and Diary packages are now part
of the standard GNU Emacs, as is Calc.

   <p>You can use a <code>load</code> command to evaluate a complete file and
thereby install all the functions and variables in the file into Emacs. 
For example:

<!-- (auto-compression-mode t) -->
<pre class="smallexample">     (load "~/emacs/slowsplit")
</pre>
   <p>This evaluates, i.e., loads, the <samp><span class="file">slowsplit.el</span></samp> file or if it
exists, the faster, byte compiled <samp><span class="file">slowsplit.elc</span></samp> file from the
<samp><span class="file">emacs</span></samp> sub-directory of your home directory.  The file contains
the function <code>split-window-quietly</code>, which John Robinson wrote in
1989.

   <p>The <code>split-window-quietly</code> function splits a window with the
minimum of redisplay.  I installed it in 1989 because it worked well
with the slow 1200 baud terminals I was then using.  Nowadays, I only
occasionally come across such a slow connection, but I continue to use
the function because I like the way it leaves the bottom half of a
buffer in the lower of the new windows and the top half in the upper
window.

   <p>To replace the key binding for the default
<code>split-window-vertically</code>, you must also unset that key and bind
the keys to <code>split-window-quietly</code>, like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (global-unset-key "\C-x2")
     (global-set-key "\C-x2" 'split-window-quietly)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-load_002dpath-338"></a>If you load many extensions, as I do, then instead of specifying the
exact location of the extension file, as shown above, you can specify
that directory as part of Emacs's <code>load-path</code>.  Then, when Emacs
loads a file, it will search that directory as well as its default
list of directories.  (The default list is specified in <samp><span class="file">paths.h</span></samp>
when Emacs is built.)

   <p>The following command adds your <samp><span class="file">~/emacs</span></samp> directory to the
existing load path:

<pre class="smallexample">     ;;; Emacs Load Path
     (setq load-path (cons "~/emacs" load-path))
</pre>
   <p>Incidentally, <code>load-library</code> is an interactive interface to the
<code>load</code> function.  The complete function looks like this:

   <p><a name="index-load_002dlibrary-339"></a>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun load-library (library)
       "Load the Emacs Lisp library named LIBRARY.
     This is an interface to the function `load'.  LIBRARY is searched
     for in `load-path', both with and without `load-suffixes' (as
     well as `load-file-rep-suffixes').
     
     See Info node `(emacs)Lisp Libraries' for more details.
     See `load-file' for a different interface to `load'."
       (interactive
        (list (completing-read "Load library: "
                               (apply-partially 'locate-file-completion-table
                                                load-path
                                                (get-load-suffixes)))))
       (load library))
</pre>
   <p>The name of the function, <code>load-library</code>, comes from the use of
&ldquo;library&rdquo; as a conventional synonym for &ldquo;file&rdquo;.  The source for the
<code>load-library</code> command is in the <samp><span class="file">files.el</span></samp> library.

   <p>Another interactive command that does a slightly different job is
<code>load-file</code>.  See <a href="../emacs/Lisp-Libraries.html#Lisp-Libraries">Libraries of Lisp Code for Emacs</a>, for information on the
distinction between <code>load-library</code> and this command.
