<h4 class="subsection">1.8.5 The <code>message</code> Function</h4>

<p><a name="index-message-59"></a>
Like <code>+</code>, the <code>message</code> function takes a variable number of
arguments.  It is used to send messages to the user and is so useful
that we will describe it here.

   <p>A message is printed in the echo area.  For example, you can print a
message in your echo area by evaluating the following list:

<pre class="smallexample">     (message "This message appears in the echo area!")
</pre>
   <p>The whole string between double quotation marks is a single argument
and is printed <i>in toto</i>.  (Note that in this example, the message
itself will appear in the echo area within double quotes; that is
because you see the value returned by the <code>message</code> function.  In
most uses of <code>message</code> in programs that you write, the text will
be printed in the echo area as a side-effect, without the quotes. 
See <a href="multiply_002dby_002dseven-in-detail.html#multiply_002dby_002dseven-in-detail"><code>multiply-by-seven</code> in detail</a>, for an example of this.)

   <p>However, if there is a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>&rsquo; in the quoted string of characters, the
<code>message</code> function does not print the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>&rsquo; as such, but looks
to the argument that follows the string.  It evaluates the second
argument and prints the value at the location in the string where the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>&rsquo; is.

   <p>You can see this by positioning the cursor after the following
expression and typing <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>:

<pre class="smallexample">     (message "The name of this buffer is: %s." (buffer-name))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In Info, <code>"The name of this buffer is: *info*."</code> will appear in the
echo area.  The function <code>buffer-name</code> returns the name of the
buffer as a string, which the <code>message</code> function inserts in place
of <code>%s</code>.

   <p>To print a value as an integer, use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>&rsquo; in the same way as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>&rsquo;.  For example, to print a message in the echo area that
states the value of the <code>fill-column</code>, evaluate the following:

<pre class="smallexample">     (message "The value of fill-column is %d." fill-column)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">On my system, when I evaluate this list, <code>"The value of
fill-column is 72."</code> appears in my echo area<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

   <p>If there is more than one &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>&rsquo; in the quoted string, the value of
the first argument following the quoted string is printed at the
location of the first &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>&rsquo; and the value of the second argument is
printed at the location of the second &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>&rsquo;, and so on.

   <p>For example, if you evaluate the following,

<pre class="smallexample">     (message "There are %d %s in the office!"
              (- fill-column 14) "pink elephants")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">a rather whimsical message will appear in your echo area.  On my system
it says, <code>"There are 58 pink elephants in the office!"</code>.

   <p>The expression <code>(- fill-column 14)</code> is evaluated and the resulting
number is inserted in place of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>&rsquo;; and the string in double
quotes, <code>"pink elephants"</code>, is treated as a single argument and
inserted in place of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>&rsquo;.  (That is to say, a string between
double quotes evaluates to itself, like a number.)

   <p>Finally, here is a somewhat complex example that not only illustrates
the computation of a number, but also shows how you can use an
expression within an expression to generate the text that is substituted
for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>&rsquo;:

<pre class="smallexample">     (message "He saw %d %s"
              (- fill-column 32)
              (concat "red "
                      (substring
                       "The quick brown foxes jumped." 16 21)
                      " leaping."))
</pre>
   <p>In this example, <code>message</code> has three arguments: the string,
<code>"He saw %d %s"</code>, the expression, <code>(- fill-column 32)</code>, and
the expression beginning with the function <code>concat</code>.  The value
resulting from the evaluation of <code>(- fill-column 32)</code> is inserted
in place of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>&rsquo;; and the value returned by the expression
beginning with <code>concat</code> is inserted in place of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>When your fill column is 70 and you evaluate the expression, the
message <code>"He saw 38 red foxes leaping."</code> appears in your echo
area.

<hr>
<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> Actually, you
can use <code>%s</code> to print a number.  It is non-specific.  <code>%d</code>
prints only the part of a number left of a decimal point, and not
anything that is not a number.</p>
