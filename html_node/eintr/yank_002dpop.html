<h3 class="appendixsec">B.3 <code>yank-pop</code></h3>

<p><a name="index-yank_002dpop-372"></a>
After understanding <code>yank</code> and <code>current-kill</code>, you know how
to approach the <code>yank-pop</code> function.  Leaving out the
documentation to save space, it looks like this:

<!-- GNU Emacs 22 -->
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun yank-pop (&amp;optional arg)
       "..."
       (interactive "*p")
       (if (not (eq last-command 'yank))
           (error "Previous command was not a yank"))
       (setq this-command 'yank)
       (unless arg (setq arg 1))
       (let ((inhibit-read-only t)
             (before (&lt; (point) (mark t))))
         (if before
             (funcall (or yank-undo-function 'delete-region) (point) (mark t))
           (funcall (or yank-undo-function 'delete-region) (mark t) (point)))
         (setq yank-undo-function nil)
         (set-marker (mark-marker) (point) (current-buffer))
         (insert-for-yank (current-kill arg))
         ;; Set the window start back where it was in the yank command,
         ;; if possible.
         (set-window-start (selected-window) yank-window-start t)
         (if before
             ;; This is like exchange-point-and-mark,
             ;;     but doesn't activate the mark.
             ;; It is cleaner to avoid activation, even though the command
             ;; loop would deactivate the mark because we inserted text.
             (goto-char (prog1 (mark t)
                          (set-marker (mark-marker)
                                      (point)
                                      (current-buffer))))))
       nil)
</pre>
   <p>The function is interactive with a small &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo; so the prefix
argument is processed and passed to the function.  The command can
only be used after a previous yank; otherwise an error message is
sent.  This check uses the variable <code>last-command</code> which is set
by <code>yank</code> and is discussed elsewhere. 
(See <a href="copy_002dregion_002das_002dkill.html#copy_002dregion_002das_002dkill">copy-region-as-kill</a>.)

   <p>The <code>let</code> clause sets the variable <code>before</code> to true or false
depending whether point is before or after mark and then the region
between point and mark is deleted.  This is the region that was just
inserted by the previous yank and it is this text that will be
replaced.

   <p><code>funcall</code> calls its first argument as a function, passing
remaining arguments to it.  The first argument is whatever the
<code>or</code> expression returns.  The two remaining arguments are the
positions of point and mark set by the preceding <code>yank</code> command.

   <p>There is more, but that is the hardest part.
