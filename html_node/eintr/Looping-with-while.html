<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Looping with <code>while</code></h4>

   <p>So long as the true-or-false-test of the <code>while</code> expression
returns a true value when it is evaluated, the body is repeatedly
evaluated.  This process is called a loop since the Lisp interpreter
repeats the same thing again and again, like an airplane doing a loop. 
When the result of evaluating the true-or-false-test is false, the
Lisp interpreter does not evaluate the rest of the <code>while</code>
expression and exits the loop.

   <p>Clearly, if the value returned by evaluating the first argument to
<code>while</code> is always true, the body following will be evaluated
again and again <small class="dots">...</small> and again <small class="dots">...</small> forever.  Conversely, if the
value returned is never true, the expressions in the body will never
be evaluated.  The craft of writing a <code>while</code> loop consists of
choosing a mechanism such that the true-or-false-test returns true
just the number of times that you want the subsequent expressions to
be evaluated, and then have the test return false.

   <p>The value returned by evaluating a <code>while</code> is the value of the
true-or-false-test.  An interesting consequence of this is that a
<code>while</code> loop that evaluates without error will return <code>nil</code>
or false regardless of whether it has looped 1 or 100 times or none at
all.  A <code>while</code> expression that evaluates successfully never
returns a true value!  What this means is that <code>while</code> is always
evaluated for its side effects, which is to say, the consequences of
evaluating the expressions within the body of the <code>while</code> loop. 
This makes sense.  It is not the mere act of looping that is desired,
but the consequences of what happens when the expressions in the loop
are repeatedly evaluated.
