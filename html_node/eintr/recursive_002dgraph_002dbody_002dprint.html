<h3 class="section">15.2 The <code>recursive-graph-body-print</code> Function</h3>

<p><a name="index-recursive_002dgraph_002dbody_002dprint-303"></a>
The <code>graph-body-print</code> function may also be written recursively. 
The recursive solution is divided into two parts: an outside wrapper
that uses a <code>let</code> expression to determine the values of several
variables that need only be found once, such as the maximum height of
the graph, and an inside function that is called recursively to print
the graph.

   <p>The wrapper is uncomplicated:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defun recursive-graph-body-print (numbers-list)
       "Print a bar graph of the NUMBERS-LIST.
     The numbers-list consists of the Y-axis values."
       (let ((height (apply 'max numbers-list))
             (symbol-width (length graph-blank))
             from-position)
         (recursive-graph-body-print-internal
          numbers-list
          height
          symbol-width)))
</pre>
   <p>The recursive function is a little more difficult.  It has four parts:
the do-again-test, the printing code, the recursive call, and the
next-step-expression.  The do-again-test is a <code>when</code>
expression that determines whether the <code>numbers-list</code> contains
any remaining elements; if it does, the function prints one column of
the graph using the printing code and calls itself again.  The
function calls itself again according to the value produced by the
next-step-expression which causes the call to act on a shorter
version of the <code>numbers-list</code>.

<pre class="smallexample">     (defun recursive-graph-body-print-internal
       (numbers-list height symbol-width)
       "Print a bar graph.
     Used within recursive-graph-body-print function."
     
       (when numbers-list
             (setq from-position (point))
             (insert-rectangle
              (column-of-graph height (car numbers-list)))
             (goto-char from-position)
             (forward-char symbol-width)
             (sit-for 0)     ; <span class="roman">Draw graph column by column.</span>
             (recursive-graph-body-print-internal
              (cdr numbers-list) height symbol-width)))
</pre>
   <p>After installation, this expression can be tested; here is a sample:

<pre class="smallexample">     (recursive-graph-body-print '(3 2 5 6 7 5 3 4 6 4 3 2 1))
</pre>
   <p>Here is what <code>recursive-graph-body-print</code> produces:

<pre class="smallexample">                     *
                    **   *
                   ****  *
                   **** ***
                 * *********
                 ************
                 *************
</pre>
   <p>Either of these two functions, <code>graph-body-print</code> or
<code>recursive-graph-body-print</code>, create the body of a graph.
