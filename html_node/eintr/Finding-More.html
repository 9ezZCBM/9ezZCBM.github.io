<p><a name="index-describe_002dfunction_0040r_007b_002c-introduced_007d-141"></a><a name="index-Find-function-documentation-142"></a>In this walk-through, I will describe each new function as we come to
it, sometimes in detail and sometimes briefly.  If you are interested,
you can get the full documentation of any Emacs Lisp function at any
time by typing <kbd>C-h f</kbd> and then the name of the function (and then
&lt;RET&gt;).  Similarly, you can get the full documentation for a
variable by typing <kbd>C-h v</kbd> and then the name of the variable (and
then &lt;RET&gt;).

   <p><a name="index-Find-source-of-function-143"></a><!-- In version 22, tells location both of C and of Emacs Lisp -->
Also, <code>describe-function</code> will tell you the location of the
function definition.

   <p>Put point into the name of the file that contains the function and
press the &lt;RET&gt; key.  In this case, &lt;RET&gt; means
<code>push-button</code> rather than &ldquo;return&rdquo; or &ldquo;enter&rdquo;.  Emacs will take
you directly to the function definition.

   <p>More generally, if you want to see a function in its original source
file, you can use the <code>xref-find-definitions</code> function to jump to
it.  <code>xref-find-definitions</code> works with a wide variety of
languages, not just Lisp, and C, and it works with non-programming
text as well.  For example, <code>xref-find-definitions</code> will jump to
the various nodes in the Texinfo source file of this document
(provided that you've run the <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> utility to record all
the nodes in the manuals that come with Emacs; see <a href="../emacs/Create-Tags-Table.html#Create-Tags-Table">Create Tags Table</a>).

   <p>To use the <code>xref-find-definitions</code> command, type <kbd>M-.</kbd>
(i.e., press the period key while holding down the &lt;META&gt; key, or
else type the &lt;ESC&gt; key and then type the period key), and then,
at the prompt, type in the name of the function whose source code you
want to see, such as <code>mark-whole-buffer</code>, and then type
&lt;RET&gt;.  (If the command doesn't prompt, invoke it with an
argument: <kbd>C-u M-.</kbd>; see <a href="Interactive-Options.html#Interactive-Options">Interactive Options</a>.)  Emacs will
switch buffers and display the source code for the function on your
screen<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  To switch back to your current buffer, type <kbd>M-,</kbd> or
<kbd>C-x b &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  (On some keyboards, the &lt;META&gt; key is
labeled &lt;ALT&gt;.)

   <p><a name="index-Library_002c-as-term-for-_0060_0060file_0027_0027-144"></a>Incidentally, the files that contain Lisp code are conventionally
called <dfn>libraries</dfn>.  The metaphor is derived from that of a
specialized library, such as a law library or an engineering library,
rather than a general library.  Each library, or file, contains
functions that relate to a particular topic or activity, such as
<samp><span class="file">abbrev.el</span></samp> for handling abbreviations and other typing
shortcuts, and <samp><span class="file">help.el</span></samp> for help.  (Sometimes several
libraries provide code for a single activity, as the various
<samp><span class="file">rmail...</span></samp> files provide code for reading electronic mail.) 
In <cite>The GNU Emacs Manual</cite>, you will see sentences such as &ldquo;The
<kbd>C-h p</kbd> command lets you search the standard Emacs Lisp libraries
by topic keywords.&rdquo;

<hr>
<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> 
If instead of showing the source code for a Lisp function, Emacs asks
you which tags table to visit, invoke <kbd>M-.</kbd> from a buffer whose
major mode is Emacs Lisp or Lisp Interaction.
