<h3 class="section">16.2 Specifying Variables using <code>defcustom</code></h3>

<p><a name="index-defcustom-310"></a>
You can specify variables using <code>defcustom</code> so that you and
others can then use Emacs's <code>customize</code> feature to set their
values.  (You cannot use <code>customize</code> to write function
definitions; but you can write <code>defuns</code> in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>
file.  Indeed, you can write any Lisp expression in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>
file.)

   <p>The <code>customize</code> feature depends on the <code>defcustom</code> macro. 
Although you can use <code>defvar</code> or <code>setq</code> for variables that
users set, the <code>defcustom</code> macro is designed for the job.

   <p>You can use your knowledge of <code>defvar</code> for writing the
first three arguments for <code>defcustom</code>.  The first argument to
<code>defcustom</code> is the name of the variable.  The second argument is
the variable's initial value, if any; and this value is set only if
the value has not already been set.  The third argument is the
documentation.

   <p>The fourth and subsequent arguments to <code>defcustom</code> specify types
and options; these are not featured in <code>defvar</code>.  (These
arguments are optional.)

   <p>Each of these arguments consists of a keyword followed by a value. 
Each keyword starts with the colon character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>For example, the customizable user option variable
<code>text-mode-hook</code> looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defcustom text-mode-hook nil
       "Normal hook run when entering Text mode and many related modes."
       :type 'hook
       :options '(turn-on-auto-fill flyspell-mode)
       :group 'wp)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The name of the variable is <code>text-mode-hook</code>; it has no default
value; and its documentation string tells you what it does.

   <p>The <code>:type</code> keyword tells Emacs the kind of data to which
<code>text-mode-hook</code> should be set and how to display the value in a
Customization buffer.

   <p>The <code>:options</code> keyword specifies a suggested list of values for
the variable.  Usually, <code>:options</code> applies to a hook. 
The list is only a suggestion; it is not exclusive; a person who sets
the variable may set it to other values; the list shown following the
<code>:options</code> keyword is intended to offer convenient choices to a
user.

   <p>Finally, the <code>:group</code> keyword tells the Emacs Customization
command in which group the variable is located.  This tells where to
find it.

   <p>The <code>defcustom</code> macro recognizes more than a dozen keywords. 
For more information, see <a href="../elisp/Customization.html#Customization">Writing Customization Definitions</a>.

   <p>Consider <code>text-mode-hook</code> as an example.

   <p>There are two ways to customize this variable.  You can use the
customization command or write the appropriate expressions yourself.

   <p>Using the customization command,  you can type:

<pre class="smallexample">     M-x customize
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and find that the group for editing files of text is called &ldquo;Text&rdquo;. 
Enter that group.  Text Mode Hook is the first member.  You can click
on its various options, such as <code>turn-on-auto-fill</code>, to set the
values.  After you click on the button to

<pre class="smallexample">     Save for Future Sessions
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Emacs will write an expression into your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file. 
It will look like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (custom-set-variables
       ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
       ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
       ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
       ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
      '(text-mode-hook (quote (turn-on-auto-fill text-mode-hook-identify))))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(The <code>text-mode-hook-identify</code> function tells
<code>toggle-text-mode-auto-fill</code> which buffers are in Text mode. 
It comes on automatically.)

   <p>The <code>custom-set-variables</code> function works somewhat differently
than a <code>setq</code>.  While I have never learned the differences, I
modify the <code>custom-set-variables</code> expressions in my <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>
file by hand:  I make the changes in what appears to me to be a
reasonable manner and have not had any problems.  Others prefer to use
the Customization command and let Emacs do the work for them.

   <p>Another <code>custom-set-...</code> function is <code>custom-set-faces</code>. 
This function sets the various font faces.  Over time, I have set a
considerable number of faces.  Some of the time, I re-set them using
<code>customize</code>; other times, I simply edit the
<code>custom-set-faces</code> expression in my <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file itself.

   <p>The second way to customize your <code>text-mode-hook</code> is to set it
yourself in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file using code that has nothing to do
with the <code>custom-set-...</code> functions.

   <p>When you do this, and later use <code>customize</code>, you will see a
message that says

<pre class="smallexample">     CHANGED outside Customize; operating on it here may be unreliable.
</pre>
   <p>This message is only a warning.  If you click on the button to

<pre class="smallexample">     Save for Future Sessions
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Emacs will write a <code>custom-set-...</code> expression near the end
of your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file that will be evaluated after your
hand-written expression.  It will, therefore, overrule your
hand-written expression.  No harm will be done.  When you do this,
however, be careful to remember which expression is active; if you
forget, you may confuse yourself.

   <p>So long as you remember where the values are set, you will have no
trouble.  In any event, the values are always set in your
initialization file, which is usually called <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>.

   <p>I myself use <code>customize</code> for hardly anything.  Mostly, I write
expressions myself.

   <p><a name="index-defsubst-311"></a><a name="index-defconst-312"></a>Incidentally, to be more complete concerning defines:  <code>defsubst</code>
defines an inline function.  The syntax is just like that of
<code>defun</code>.  <code>defconst</code> defines a symbol as a constant.  The
intent is that neither programs nor users should ever change a value
set by <code>defconst</code>.  (You can change it; the value set is a
variable; but please do not.)
