<h3 class="section">12.4 <code>forward-paragraph</code>: a Goldmine of Functions</h3>

<p><a name="index-forward_002dparagraph-264"></a>

   <p>The <code>forward-paragraph</code> function moves point forward to the end
of the paragraph.  It is usually bound to <kbd>M-}</kbd> and makes use of a
number of functions that are important in themselves, including
<code>let*</code>, <code>match-beginning</code>, and <code>looking-at</code>.

   <p>The function definition for <code>forward-paragraph</code> is considerably
longer than the function definition for <code>forward-sentence</code>
because it works with a paragraph, each line of which may begin with a
fill prefix.

   <p>A fill prefix consists of a string of characters that are repeated at
the beginning of each line.  For example, in Lisp code, it is a
convention to start each line of a paragraph-long comment with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;;; </span></samp>&rsquo;.  In Text mode, four blank spaces make up another common
fill prefix, creating an indented paragraph.  (See <a href="../emacs/Fill-Prefix.html#Fill-Prefix">Fill Prefix</a>, for more information about fill
prefixes.)

   <p>The existence of a fill prefix means that in addition to being able to
find the end of a paragraph whose lines begin on the left-most
column, the <code>forward-paragraph</code> function must be able to find the
end of a paragraph when all or many of the lines in the buffer begin
with the fill prefix.

   <p>Moreover, it is sometimes practical to ignore a fill prefix that
exists, especially when blank lines separate paragraphs. 
This is an added complication.
