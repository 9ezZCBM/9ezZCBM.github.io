<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Complications</h4>

   <p>Now, for the first complication.  In addition to lists, the Lisp
interpreter can evaluate a symbol that is not quoted and does not have
parentheses around it.  The Lisp interpreter will attempt to determine
the symbol's value as a <dfn>variable</dfn>.  This situation is described
in the section on variables.  (See <a href="Variables.html#Variables">Variables</a>.)

   <p><a name="index-Special-form-32"></a>The second complication occurs because some functions are unusual and
do not work in the usual manner.  Those that don't are called
<dfn>special forms</dfn>.  They are used for special jobs, like defining a
function, and there are not many of them.  In the next few chapters,
you will be introduced to several of the more important special forms.

   <p>As well as special forms, there are also <dfn>macros</dfn>.  A macro
is a construct defined in Lisp, which differs from a function in that it
translates a Lisp expression into another expression that is to be
evaluated in place of the original expression.  (See <a href="Lisp-macro.html#Lisp-macro">Lisp macro</a>.)

   <p>For the purposes of this introduction, you do not need to worry too much
about whether something is a special form, macro, or ordinary function. 
For example, <code>if</code> is a special form (see <a href="if.html#if">if</a>), but <code>when</code>
is a macro (see <a href="Lisp-macro.html#Lisp-macro">Lisp macro</a>).  In earlier versions of Emacs,
<code>defun</code> was a special form, but now it is a macro (see <a href="defun.html#defun">defun</a>). 
It still behaves in the same way.

   <p>The final complication is this: if the function that the
Lisp interpreter is looking at is not a special form, and if it is part
of a list, the Lisp interpreter looks to see whether the list has a list
inside of it.  If there is an inner list, the Lisp interpreter first
figures out what it should do with the inside list, and then it works on
the outside list.  If there is yet another list embedded inside the
inner list, it works on that one first, and so on.  It always works on
the innermost list first.  The interpreter works on the innermost list
first, to evaluate the result of that list.  The result may be
used by the enclosing expression.

   <p>Otherwise, the interpreter works left to right, from one expression to
the next.
