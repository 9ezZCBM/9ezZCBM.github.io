<h3 class="section">6.3 Exercise with Narrowing</h3>

<p>Write a function that will display the first 60 characters of the
current buffer, even if you have narrowed the buffer to its latter
half so that the first line is inaccessible.  Restore point, mark, and
narrowing.  For this exercise, you need to use a whole potpourri of
functions, including <code>save-restriction</code>, <code>widen</code>,
<code>goto-char</code>, <code>point-min</code>, <code>message</code>, and
<code>buffer-substring</code>.

   <p><a name="index-Properties_002c-mention-of-_0040code_007bbuffer_002dsubstring_002dno_002dproperties_007d-173"></a>(<code>buffer-substring</code> is a previously unmentioned function you will
have to investigate yourself; or perhaps you will have to use
<code>buffer-substring-no-properties</code> or
<code>filter-buffer-substring</code> <small class="dots">...</small>, yet other functions.  Text
properties are a feature otherwise not discussed here.  See <a href="../elisp/Text-Properties.html#Text-Properties">Text Properties</a>.)

   <p>Additionally, do you really need <code>goto-char</code> or <code>point-min</code>? 
Or can you write the function without them?
