<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p><a name="index-MUA-1"></a><a name="index-NUA-2"></a>Supercite is a GNU Emacs package written entirely in Emacs Lisp.  It
interfaces to most of the commonly used Emacs mail user agents
(<dfn>MUAs</dfn>) and news user agents (<dfn>NUAs</dfn>), and provides
sophisticated facilities for the citing and attributing of message
replies.  Supercite has a very specific and limited role in the
process of composing replies to both USENET network news and
electronic mail.

   <p>The preferred way to spell Supercite is with a capital &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">S</span></samp>&rsquo;,
lowercase &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">upercite</span></samp>&rsquo;.

</ul>

<!-- FIXME: move it above the menu?  -xfq -->
   <p>Supercite is only useful in conjunction with MUAs and NUAs such as VM,
Gnus, RMAIL, MH-E, etc.  Supercite is typically called by the MUA after a
reply buffer has been setup.  Thereafter, Supercite's many commands and
formatting styles are available in that reply buffer until the reply is
sent.  Supercite is re-initialized in each new reply buffer.
