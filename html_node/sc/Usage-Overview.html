Typical usage is as follows.  You want to reply or followup to a
message in your MUA.  You will probably hit <kbd>r</kbd> (i.e., &ldquo;reply&rdquo;)
or <kbd>f</kbd> (i.e., &ldquo;forward&rdquo;) to begin composing the reply.  In
response, the MUA will create a reply buffer and initialize the
outgoing mail headers appropriately.  The body of the reply will
usually be empty at this point.  You now decide that you would like to
include part of the original message in your reply.  To do this, you
<dfn>yank</dfn> the original message into the reply buffer, typically with
a key stroke such as <kbd>C-c C-y</kbd>.  This sequence will invoke an
MUA-specific function which fills the body of the reply with the
original message and then <dfn>attributes</dfn> this text to its author. 
This is called <dfn>citing</dfn> and its effect is to prefix every line
from the original message with a special text tag.  Most MUAs provide
some default style of citing; by using Supercite you gain a wider
flexibility in the look and style of citations.  Supercite's only job
is to cite the original message.
