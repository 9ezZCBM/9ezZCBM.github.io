<h2 class="chapter">8 Alternative buses and environments.</h2>

<p><a name="index-bus-names-58"></a><a name="index-UNIX-domain-socket-59"></a><a name="index-TCP_002fIP-socket-60"></a>
Until now, we have spoken about the system and the session buses,
which are the default buses to be connected to.  However, it is
possible to connect to any bus, from which the address is known.  This
is a UNIX domain or TCP/IP socket.  Everywhere, where a <var>bus</var> is
mentioned as argument of a function (the symbol <code>:system</code> or the
symbol <code>:session</code>), this address can be used instead.  The
connection to this bus must be initialized first.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>dbus-init-bus</b><var> bus &amp;optional private<a name="index-dbus_002dinit_002dbus-61"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Establish the connection to D-Bus <var>bus</var>.

        <p><var>bus</var> can be either the symbol <code>:system</code> or the symbol
<code>:session</code>, or it can be a string denoting the address of the
corresponding bus.  For the system and session buses, this function
is called when loading <samp><span class="file">dbus.el</span></samp>, there is no need to call it
again.

        <p>The function returns a number, which counts the connections this Emacs
session has established to the <var>bus</var> under the same unique name
(see <code>dbus-get-unique-name</code>).  It depends on the libraries Emacs
is linked with, and on the environment Emacs is running.  For example,
if Emacs is linked with the GTK+ toolkit, and it runs in a GTK+-aware
environment like Gnome, another connection might already be
established.

        <p>When <var>private</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, a new connection is established
instead of reusing an existing one.  It results in a new unique name
at the bus.  This can be used, if it is necessary to distinguish from
another connection used in the same Emacs process, like the one
established by GTK+.  It should be used with care for at least the
<code>:system</code> and <code>:session</code> buses, because other Emacs Lisp
packages might already use this connection to those buses.

        <p>Example: You initialize a connection to the AT-SPI bus on your host:

     <pre class="lisp">          (setq my-bus
            (dbus-call-method
             :session "org.a11y.Bus" "/org/a11y/bus"
             "org.a11y.Bus" "GetAddress"))
          
          &rArr; "unix:abstract=/tmp/dbus-2yzWHOCdSD,guid=a490dd26625870ca1298b6e10000fd7f"
          
          ;; If Emacs is built with GTK+ support, and you run in a GTK+-enabled
          ;; environment (like a GNOME session), the initialization reuses the
          ;; connection established by GTK+'s atk bindings.
          (dbus-init-bus my-bus)
          
          &rArr; 2
          
          (dbus-get-unique-name my-bus)
          
          &rArr; ":1.19"
          
          ;; Open a new connection to the same bus.  This obsoletes the
          ;; previous one.
          (dbus-init-bus my-bus 'private)
          
          &rArr; 1
          
          (dbus-get-unique-name my-bus)
          
          &rArr; ":1.20"
</pre>
        <p>D-Bus addresses can specify different transport.  A possible address
could be based on TCP/IP sockets, see next example.  However, it
depends on the bus daemon configuration, which transport is supported. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>dbus-setenv</b><var> bus variable value<a name="index-dbus_002dsetenv-62"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Set the value of the <var>bus</var> environment variable <var>variable</var> to
<var>value</var>.

        <p><var>bus</var> is either a Lisp symbol, <code>:system</code> or <code>:session</code>,
or a string denoting the bus address.  Both <var>variable</var> and
<var>value</var> should be strings.

        <p>Normally, services inherit the environment of the bus daemon.  This
function adds to or modifies that environment when activating services.

        <p>Some bus instances, such as <code>:system</code>, may disable setting the
environment.  In such cases, or if this feature is not available in
older D-Bus versions, a <code>dbus-error</code> error is raised.

        <p>As an example, it might be desirable to start X11 enabled services on
a remote host's bus on the same X11 server the local Emacs is
running.  This could be achieved by

     <pre class="lisp">          (setq my-bus "unix:host=example.gnu.org,port=4711")
          
          &rArr; "unix:host=example.gnu.org,port=4711"
          
          (dbus-init-bus my-bus)
          
          &rArr; 1
          
          (dbus-setenv my-bus "DISPLAY" (getenv "DISPLAY"))
          
          &rArr; nil
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>
