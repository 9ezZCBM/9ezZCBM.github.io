<h3 class="section">8.3 Deadlines and scheduling</h3>

<p>A timestamp may be preceded by special keywords to facilitate planning.  Both
the timestamp and the keyword have to be positioned immediately after the task
they refer to.

     <dl>
<dt><var>DEADLINE</var><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bDEADLINE_007d-keyword-868"></a>
Meaning: the task (most likely a TODO item, though not necessarily) is supposed
to be finished on that date.

     <p><a name="index-org_002ddeadline_002dwarning_002ddays-869"></a><a name="index-org_002dagenda_002dskip_002ddeadline_002dprewarning_002dif_002dscheduled-870"></a>On the deadline date, the task will be listed in the agenda.  In
addition, the agenda for <em>today</em> will carry a warning about the
approaching or missed deadline, starting
<code>org-deadline-warning-days</code> before the due date, and continuing
until the entry is marked DONE.  An example:

     <pre class="example">          *** TODO write article about the Earth for the Guide
              DEADLINE: &lt;2004-02-29 Sun&gt;
              The editor in charge is [[bbdb:Ford Prefect]]
</pre>
     <p>You can specify a different lead time for warnings for a specific
deadline using the following syntax.  Here is an example with a warning
period of 5 days <code>DEADLINE: &lt;2004-02-29 Sun -5d&gt;</code>.  This warning is
deactivated if the task gets scheduled and you set
<code>org-agenda-skip-deadline-prewarning-if-scheduled</code> to <code>t</code>.

     <br><dt><var>SCHEDULED</var><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bSCHEDULED_007d-keyword-871"></a>
Meaning: you are planning to start working on that task on the given
date.

     <p><a name="index-org_002dagenda_002dskip_002dscheduled_002dif_002ddone-872"></a>The headline will be listed under the given date<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  In
addition, a reminder that the scheduled date has passed will be present
in the compilation for <em>today</em>, until the entry is marked DONE, i.e.,
the task will automatically be forwarded until completed.

     <pre class="example">          *** TODO Call Trillian for a date on New Years Eve.
              SCHEDULED: &lt;2004-12-25 Sat&gt;
</pre>
     <p><a name="index-org_002dscheduled_002ddelay_002ddays-873"></a><a name="index-org_002dagenda_002dskip_002dscheduled_002ddelay_002dif_002ddeadline-874"></a>If you want to <em>delay</em> the display of this task in the agenda, use
<code>SCHEDULED: &lt;2004-12-25 Sat -2d&gt;</code>: the task is still scheduled on the
25th but will appear two days later.  In case the task contains a repeater,
the delay is considered to affect all occurrences; if you want the delay to
only affect the first scheduled occurrence of the task, use <code>--2d</code>
instead.  See <code>org-scheduled-delay-days</code> and
<code>org-agenda-skip-scheduled-delay-if-deadline</code> for details on how to
control this globally or per agenda.

     <p class="noindent"><b>Important:</b> Scheduling an item in Org mode should <i>not</i> be
understood in the same way that we understand <i>scheduling a meeting</i>. 
Setting a date for a meeting is just a simple appointment, you should
mark this entry with a simple plain timestamp, to get this item shown
on the date where it applies.  This is a frequent misunderstanding by
Org users.  In Org mode, <i>scheduling</i> means setting a date when you
want to start working on an action item. 
</dl>

   <p>You may use timestamps with repeaters in scheduling and deadline
entries.  Org mode will issue early and late warnings based on the
assumption that the timestamp represents the <i>nearest instance</i> of
the repeater.  However, the use of diary sexp entries like
<code>&lt;%%(diary-float t 42)&gt;</code>
in scheduling and deadline timestamps is limited.  Org mode does not
know enough about the internals of each sexp function to issue early and
late warnings.  However, it will show the item on each day where the
sexp entry matches.
