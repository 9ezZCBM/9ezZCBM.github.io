<h4 class="subsection">13.1.6 Links between published files</h4>

<p><a name="index-links_002c-publishing-2062"></a>
To create a link from one Org file to another, you would use something like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[[file:foo.org][The foo]]</span></samp>&rsquo; or simply &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">file:foo.org</span></samp>&rsquo;
(see <a href="External-links.html#External-links">External links</a>).  When published, this link becomes a link to
<samp><span class="file">foo.html</span></samp>.  You can thus interlink the pages of your &ldquo;org web&rdquo;
project and the links will work as expected when you publish them to HTML. 
If you also publish the Org source file and want to link to it, use an
<code>http:</code> link instead of a <code>file:</code> link, because <code>file:</code> links
are converted to link to the corresponding <samp><span class="file">html</span></samp> file.

   <p>You may also link to related files, such as images.  Provided you are careful
with relative file names, and provided you have also configured Org to upload
the related files, these links will work too.  See <a href="Complex-example.html#Complex-example">Complex example</a>, for
an example of this usage.

   <p>Eventually, links between published documents can contain some search options
(see <a href="Search-options.html#Search-options">Search options</a>), which will be resolved to the appropriate location
in the linked file.  For example, once published to HTML, the following links
all point to a dedicated anchor in <samp><span class="file">foo.html</span></samp>.

<pre class="example">     [[file:foo.org::*heading]]
     [[file:foo.org::#custom-id]]
     [[file:foo.org::target]]
</pre>
   </body></html>
