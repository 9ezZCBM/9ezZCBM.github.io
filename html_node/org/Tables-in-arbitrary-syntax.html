<h3 class="section">A.6 Tables and lists in arbitrary syntax</h3>

<p><a name="index-tables_002c-in-other-modes-2394"></a><a name="index-lists_002c-in-other-modes-2395"></a><a name="index-Orgtbl-mode-2396"></a>
Because of Org's success in handling tables with Orgtbl, a frequently asked
feature is to Org's usability functions to other table formats native to
other modem's, such as LaTeX.  This would be hard to do in a general way
without complicated customization nightmares.  Moreover, that would take Org
away from its simplicity roots that Orgtbl has proven.  There is, however, an
alternate approach to accomplishing the same.

   <p>This approach involves implementing a custom <em>translate</em> function that
operates on a native Org <em>source table</em> to produce a table in another
format.  This strategy would keep the excellently working Orgtbl simple and
isolate complications, if any, confined to the translate function.  To add
more alien table formats, we just add more translate functions.  Also the
burden of developing custom translate functions for new table formats will be
in the hands of those who know those formats best.

   <p>For an example of how this strategy works, see Orgstruct mode.  In that mode,
Bastien added the ability to use Org's facilities to edit and re-structure
lists.  He did by turning <code>orgstruct-mode</code> on, and then exporting the
list locally to another format, such as HTML, LaTeX or Texinfo.
