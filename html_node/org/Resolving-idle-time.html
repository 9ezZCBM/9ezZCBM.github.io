<h4 class="subsection">8.4.3 Resolving idle time and continuous clocking</h4>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Resolving idle time</h5>

<p><a name="index-resolve-idle-time-941"></a><a name="index-org_002dclock_002dx11idle_002dprogram_002dname-942"></a>
<a name="index-idle_002c-resolve_002c-dangling-943"></a>If you clock in on a work item, and then walk away from your
computer&mdash;perhaps to take a phone call&mdash;you often need to &ldquo;resolve&rdquo; the
time you were away by either subtracting it from the current clock, or
applying it to another one.

   <p><a name="index-org_002dclock_002didle_002dtime-944"></a>By customizing the variable <code>org-clock-idle-time</code> to some integer, such
as 10 or 15, Emacs can alert you when you get back to your computer after
being idle for that many minutes<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, and ask what you want to do with the idle time. 
There will be a question waiting for you when you get back, indicating how
much idle time has passed (constantly updated with the current amount), as
well as a set of choices to correct the discrepancy:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>k</kbd><dd>To keep some or all of the minutes and stay clocked in, press <kbd>k</kbd>.  Org
will ask how many of the minutes to keep.  Press &lt;RET&gt; to keep them all,
effectively changing nothing, or enter a number to keep that many minutes. 
<br><dt><kbd>K</kbd><dd>If you use the shift key and press <kbd>K</kbd>, it will keep however many minutes
you request and then immediately clock out of that task.  If you keep all of
the minutes, this is the same as just clocking out of the current task. 
<br><dt><kbd>s</kbd><dd>To keep none of the minutes, use <kbd>s</kbd> to subtract all the away time from
the clock, and then check back in from the moment you returned. 
<br><dt><kbd>S</kbd><dd>To keep none of the minutes and just clock out at the start of the away time,
use the shift key and press <kbd>S</kbd>.  Remember that using shift will always
leave you clocked out, no matter which option you choose. 
<br><dt><kbd>C</kbd><dd>To cancel the clock altogether, use <kbd>C</kbd>.  Note that if instead of
canceling you subtract the away time, and the resulting clock amount is less
than a minute, the clock will still be canceled rather than clutter up the
log with an empty entry. 
</dl>

   <p>What if you subtracted those away minutes from the current clock, and now
want to apply them to a new clock?  Simply clock in to any task immediately
after the subtraction.  Org will notice that you have subtracted time &ldquo;on
the books&rdquo;, so to speak, and will ask if you want to apply those minutes to
the next task you clock in on.

   <p>There is one other instance when this clock resolution magic occurs.  Say you
were clocked in and hacking away, and suddenly your cat chased a mouse who
scared a hamster that crashed into your UPS's power button!  You suddenly
lose all your buffers, but thanks to auto-save you still have your recent Org
mode changes, including your last clock in.

   <p>If you restart Emacs and clock into any task, Org will notice that you have a
dangling clock which was never clocked out from your last session.  Using
that clock's starting time as the beginning of the unaccounted-for period,
Org will ask how you want to resolve that time.  The logic and behavior is
identical to dealing with away time due to idleness; it is just happening due
to a recovery event rather than a set amount of idle time.

   <p>You can also check all the files visited by your Org agenda for dangling
clocks at any time using <kbd>M-x org-resolve-clocks &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> (or <kbd>C-c
C-x C-z</kbd>).

<h5 class="subsubheading">Continuous clocking</h5>

<p><a name="index-continuous-clocking-945"></a><a name="index-org_002dclock_002dcontinuously-946"></a>
You may want to start clocking from the time when you clocked out the
previous task.  To enable this systematically, set <code>org-clock-continuously</code>
to <code>t</code>.  Each time you clock in, Org retrieves the clock-out time of the
last clocked entry for this session, and start the new clock from there.

   <p>If you only want this from time to time, use three universal prefix arguments
with <code>org-clock-in</code> and two <kbd>C-u C-u</kbd> with <code>org-clock-in-last</code>.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> On computers using macOS,
idleness is based on actual user idleness, not just Emacs' idle time.  For
X11, you can install a utility program <samp><span class="file">x11idle.c</span></samp>, available in the
<code>contrib/scripts</code> directory of the Org git distribution, or install the
<samp><span class="file">xprintidle</span></samp> package and set it to the variable
<code>org-clock-x11idle-program-name</code> if you are running Debian, to get the
same general treatment of idleness.  On other systems, idle time refers to
Emacs idle time only.</p>
