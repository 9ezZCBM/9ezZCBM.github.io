<p><a name="index-drawer_002c-for-state-change-recording-599"></a>
<a name="index-org_002dlog_002dstates_002dorder_002dreversed-600"></a><a name="index-org_002dlog_002dinto_002ddrawer-601"></a><a name="index-property_002c-_0040code_007bLOG_005fINTO_005fDRAWER_007d-602"></a>When TODO keywords are used as workflow states (see <a href="Workflow-states.html#Workflow-states">Workflow states</a>), you
might want to keep track of when a state change occurred and maybe take a
note about this change.  You can either record just a timestamp, or a
time-stamped note for a change.  These records will be inserted after the
headline as an itemized list, newest first<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  When taking a lot of notes, you might
want to get the notes out of the way into a drawer (see <a href="Drawers.html#Drawers">Drawers</a>). 
Customize <code>org-log-into-drawer</code> to get this behavior&mdash;the recommended
drawer for this is called <code>LOGBOOK</code><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>.  You can also
overrule the setting of this variable for a subtree by setting a
<code>LOG_INTO_DRAWER</code> property.

   <p>Since it is normally too much to record a note for every state, Org mode
expects configuration on a per-keyword basis for this.  This is achieved by
adding special markers &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo; (for a timestamp) or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo; (for a note
with timestamp) in parentheses after each keyword.  For example, with the
setting

<pre class="lisp">     (setq org-todo-keywords
       '((sequence "TODO(t)" "WAIT(w@/!)" "|" "DONE(d!)" "CANCELED(c@)")))
</pre>
   <p>To record a timestamp without a note for TODO keywords configured with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo;, just type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> to enter a blank note when prompted.

<p class="noindent"><a name="index-org_002dlog_002ddone-603"></a>You not only define global TODO keywords and fast access keys, but also
request that a time is recorded when the entry is set to
DONE<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a>, and that a note is recorded when switching to
WAIT or CANCELED.  The setting for WAIT is even more special: the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo; after the slash means that in addition to the note taken when
entering the state, a timestamp should be recorded when <i>leaving</i> the
WAIT state, if and only if the <i>target</i> state does not configure
logging for entering it.  So it has no effect when switching from WAIT
to DONE, because DONE is configured to record a timestamp only.  But
when switching from WAIT back to TODO, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/!</span></samp>&rsquo; in the WAIT
setting now triggers a timestamp even though TODO has no logging
configured.

   <p>You can use the exact same syntax for setting logging preferences local
to a buffer:
<pre class="example">     #+TODO: TODO(t) WAIT(w@/!) | DONE(d!) CANCELED(c@)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-property_002c-_0040code_007bLOGGING_007d-604"></a>In order to define logging settings that are local to a subtree or a single
item, define a <code>LOGGING</code> property in this entry.  Any non-empty
<code>LOGGING</code> property resets all logging settings to <code>nil</code>.  You may
then turn on logging for this specific tree using <code>#+STARTUP</code> keywords
like <code>lognotedone</code> or <code>logrepeat</code>, as well as adding state specific
settings like <code>TODO(!)</code>.  For example

<pre class="example">     * TODO Log each state with only a time
       :PROPERTIES:
       :LOGGING: TODO(!) WAIT(!) DONE(!) CANCELED(!)
       :END:
     * TODO Only log when switching to WAIT, and when repeating
       :PROPERTIES:
       :LOGGING: WAIT(@) logrepeat
       :END:
     * TODO No logging at all
       :PROPERTIES:
       :LOGGING: nil
       :END:
</pre>

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> See the option
<code>org-log-states-order-reversed</code></p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> Note that the
<code>LOGBOOK</code> drawer is unfolded when pressing <kbd>&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> in the agenda to
show an entry&mdash;use <kbd>C-u &lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> to keep it folded here</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-3" href="#fnd-3">3</a>]</small> It is possible that Org mode will record two timestamps
when you are using both <code>org-log-done</code> and state change logging. 
However, it will never prompt for two notes&mdash;if you have configured
both, the state change recording note will take precedence and cancel
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Closing Note</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>
