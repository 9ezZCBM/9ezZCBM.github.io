<h3 class="section">1.2 Installation</h3>

<p><a name="index-installation-5"></a>
Org is part of recent distributions of GNU Emacs, so you normally don't need
to install it.  If, for one reason or another, you want to install Org on top
of this pre-packaged version, there are three ways to do it:

     <ul>
<li>By using Emacs package system. 
<li>By downloading Org as an archive. 
<li>By using Org's git repository. 
</ul>

   <p>We <b>strongly recommend</b> to stick to a single installation method.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Using Emacs packaging system</h5>

<p>Recent Emacs distributions include a packaging system which lets you install
Elisp libraries.  You can install Org with <kbd>M-x package-install &lt;RET&gt;
org</kbd>.

<p class="noindent"><b>Important</b>: you need to do this in a session where no <code>.org</code> file has
been visited, i.e., where no Org built-in function have been loaded. 
Otherwise autoload Org functions will mess up the installation.

   <p>Then, to make sure your Org configuration is taken into account, initialize
the package system with <code>(package-initialize)</code> in your Emacs init file
before setting any Org option.  If you want to use Org's package repository,
check out the <a href="https://orgmode.org/elpa.html">Org ELPA page</a>.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Downloading Org as an archive</h5>

<p>You can download Org latest release from <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org's website</a>.  In this case, make sure you set the load-path correctly in your
Emacs init file:

<pre class="lisp">     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/orgdir/lisp")
</pre>
   <p>The downloaded archive contains contributed libraries that are not included
in Emacs.  If you want to use them, add the <samp><span class="file">contrib</span></samp> directory to your
load-path:

<pre class="lisp">     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/orgdir/contrib/lisp" t)
</pre>
   <p>Optionally, you can compile the files and/or install them in your system. 
Run <code>make help</code> to list compilation and installation options.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Using Org's git repository</h5>

<p>You can clone Org's repository and install Org like this:

<pre class="example">     $ cd ~/src/
     $ git clone https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/org-mode.git
     $ cd org-mode/
     $ make autoloads
</pre>
   <p>Note that in this case, <code>make autoloads</code> is mandatory: it defines Org's
version in <samp><span class="file">org-version.el</span></samp> and Org's autoloads in
<samp><span class="file">org-loaddefs.el</span></samp>.

   <p>Remember to add the correct load-path as described in the method above.

   <p>You can also compile with <code>make</code>, generate the documentation with
<code>make doc</code>, create a local configuration with <code>make config</code> and
install Org with <code>make install</code>.  Please run <code>make help</code> to get
the list of compilation/installation options.

   <p>For more detailed explanations on Org's build system, please check the Org
Build System page on <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-build-system.html">Worg</a>.
