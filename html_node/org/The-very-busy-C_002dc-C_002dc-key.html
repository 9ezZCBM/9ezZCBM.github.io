The <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> key in Org serves many purposes depending on the context. 
It is probably the most over-worked, multi-purpose key combination in Org. 
Its uses are well-documented through out this manual, but here is a
consolidated list for easy reference.

     <ul>
<li>If any highlights shown in the buffer from the creation of a sparse tree, or
from clock display, remove such highlights. 
<li>If the cursor is in one of the special <code>#+KEYWORD</code> lines, scan the
buffer for these lines and update the information.  Also reset the Org file
cache used to temporary store the contents of URLs used as values for
keywords like <code>#+SETUPFILE</code>. 
<li>If the cursor is inside a table, realign the table.  The table realigns even
if automatic table editor is turned off. 
<li>If the cursor is on a <code>#+TBLFM</code> line, re-apply the formulas to
the entire table. 
<li>If the current buffer is a capture buffer, close the note and file it.  With
a prefix argument, also jump to the target location after saving the note. 
<li>If the cursor is on a <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;target&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>, update radio targets and
corresponding links in this buffer. 
<li>If the cursor is on a property line or at the start or end of a property
drawer, offer property commands. 
<li>If the cursor is at a footnote reference, go to the corresponding
definition, and <em>vice versa</em>. 
<li>If the cursor is on a statistics cookie, update it. 
<li>If the cursor is in a plain list item with a checkbox, toggle the status
of the checkbox. 
<li>If the cursor is on a numbered item in a plain list, renumber the
ordered list. 
<li>If the cursor is on the <code>#+BEGIN</code> line of a dynamic block, the
block is updated. 
<li>If the cursor is at a timestamp, fix the day name in the timestamp. 
</ul>
