<h3 class="section">1.5 Typesetting conventions used in this manual</h3>

<h5 class="subsubheading">TODO keywords, tags, properties, etc.</h5>

<p>Org mainly uses three types of keywords: TODO keywords, tags and property
names.  In this manual we use the following conventions:

     <dl>
<dt><code>TODO</code><dt><code>WAITING</code><dd>TODO keywords are written with all capitals, even if they are
user-defined. 
<br><dt><code>boss</code><dt><code>ARCHIVE</code><dd>User-defined tags are written in lowercase; built-in tags with special
meaning are written with all capitals. 
<br><dt><code>Release</code><dt><code>PRIORITY</code><dd>User-defined properties are capitalized; built-in properties with
special meaning are written with all capitals. 
</dl>

   <p>Moreover, Org uses <i>option keywords</i> (like <code>#+TITLE</code> to set the title)
and <i>environment keywords</i> (like <code>#+BEGIN_EXPORT html</code> to start
a <code>HTML</code> environment).  They are written in uppercase in the manual to
enhance its readability, but you can use lowercase in your Org file.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Key bindings and commands</h5>

<p><a name="index-C_002dc-a-22"></a><a name="index-org_002dagenda-23"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-c-24"></a><a name="index-org_002dcapture-25"></a>
The manual suggests a few global key bindings, in particular <kbd>C-c a</kbd> for
<code>org-agenda</code> and <kbd>C-c c</kbd> for <code>org-capture</code>.  These are only
suggestions, but the rest of the manual assumes that these key bindings are in
place in order to list commands by key access.

   <p>Also, the manual lists both the keys and the corresponding commands for
accessing a functionality.  Org mode often uses the same key for different
functions, depending on context.  The command that is bound to such keys has
a generic name, like <code>org-metaright</code>.  In the manual we will, wherever
possible, give the function that is internally called by the generic command. 
For example, in the chapter on document structure, <kbd>M-&lt;RIGHT&gt;</kbd> will
be listed to call <code>org-do-demote</code>, while in the chapter on tables, it
will be listed to call <code>org-table-move-column-right</code>.  If you prefer,
you can compile the manual without the command names by unsetting the flag
<code>cmdnames</code> in <samp><span class="file">org.texi</span></samp>.
