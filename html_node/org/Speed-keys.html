Single keystrokes can execute custom commands in an Org file when the cursor
is on a headline.  Without the extra burden of a meta or modifier key, Speed
Keys can speed navigation or execute custom commands.  Besides faster
navigation, Speed Keys may come in handy on small mobile devices that do not
have full keyboards.  Speed Keys may also work on TTY devices known for their
problems when entering Emacs keychords.

   <p><a name="index-org_002duse_002dspeed_002dcommands-2235"></a>By default, Org has Speed Keys disabled.  To activate Speed Keys, set the
variable <code>org-use-speed-commands</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value.  To trigger
a Speed Key, the cursor must be at the beginning of an Org headline, before
any of the stars.

   <p><a name="index-org_002dspeed_002dcommands_002duser-2236"></a><a name="index-org_002dspeed_002dcommand_002dhelp-2237"></a>Org comes with a pre-defined list of Speed Keys.  To add or modify Speed
Keys, customize the variable, <code>org-speed-commands-user</code>.  For more
details, see the variable's docstring.  With Speed Keys activated, <kbd>M-x
org-speed-command-help</kbd>, or <kbd>?</kbd> when cursor is at the beginning of an Org
headline, shows currently active Speed Keys, including the user-defined ones.
