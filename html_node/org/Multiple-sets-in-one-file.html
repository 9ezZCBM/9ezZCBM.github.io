<h4 class="subsection">5.2.3 Multiple keyword sets in one file</h4>

<p><a name="index-TODO-keyword-sets-564"></a>
Sometimes you may want to use different sets of TODO keywords in
parallel.  For example, you may want to have the basic
<code>TODO</code>/<code>DONE</code>, but also a workflow for bug fixing, and a
separate state indicating that an item has been canceled (so it is not
DONE, but also does not require action).  Your setup would then look
like this:

<pre class="lisp">     (setq org-todo-keywords
           '((sequence "TODO" "|" "DONE")
             (sequence "REPORT" "BUG" "KNOWNCAUSE" "|" "FIXED")
             (sequence "|" "CANCELED")))
</pre>
   <p>The keywords should all be different, this helps Org mode to keep track
of which subsequence should be used for a given entry.  In this setup,
<kbd>C-c C-t</kbd> only operates within a subsequence, so it switches from
<code>DONE</code> to (nothing) to <code>TODO</code>, and from <code>FIXED</code> to
(nothing) to <code>REPORT</code>.  Therefore you need a mechanism to initially
select the correct sequence.  Besides the obvious ways like typing a
keyword or using completion, you may also apply the following commands:

     
<a name="index-C_002dS_002dRIGHT-565"></a>
<a name="index-C_002dS_002dLEFT-566"></a>
<a name="index-C_002du-C_002du-C_002dc-C_002dt-567"></a>
<dl><dt><kbd>C-u C-u C-c C-t</kbd><dt><kbd>C-S-&lt;RIGHT&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>C-S-&lt;LEFT&gt;</kbd><dd>These keys jump from one TODO subset to the next.  In the above example,
<kbd>C-u C-u C-c C-t</kbd> or <kbd>C-S-&lt;RIGHT&gt;</kbd> would jump from <code>TODO</code> or
<code>DONE</code> to <code>REPORT</code>, and any of the words in the second row to
<code>CANCELED</code>.  Note that the <kbd>C-S-</kbd> key binding conflict with
<code>shift-selection-mode</code> (see <a href="Conflicts.html#Conflicts">Conflicts</a>). 
<a name="index-S_002dRIGHT-568"></a><a name="index-S_002dLEFT-569"></a><br><dt><kbd>S-&lt;RIGHT&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>S-&lt;LEFT&gt;</kbd><dd><kbd>S-&lt;LEFT&gt;</kbd> and <kbd>S-&lt;RIGHT&gt;</kbd> and walk through <em>all</em>
keywords from all sets, so for example <kbd>S-&lt;RIGHT&gt;</kbd> would switch
from <code>DONE</code> to <code>REPORT</code> in the example above.  See also
<a href="Conflicts.html#Conflicts">Conflicts</a>, for a discussion of the interaction with
<code>shift-selection-mode</code>.
