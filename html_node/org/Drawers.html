<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007borg_002dinsert_002ddrawer_007d-232"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dx-d-233"></a>Sometimes you want to keep information associated with an entry, but you
normally don't want to see it.  For this, Org mode has <em>drawers</em>.  They
can contain anything but a headline and another drawer.  Drawers look like
this:

<pre class="example">     ** This is a headline
        Still outside the drawer
        :DRAWERNAME:
        This is inside the drawer.
        :END:
        After the drawer.
</pre>
   <p>You can interactively insert drawers at point by calling
<code>org-insert-drawer</code>, which is bound to <kbd>C-c C-x d</kbd>.  With an active
region, this command will put the region inside the drawer.  With a prefix
argument, this command calls <code>org-insert-property-drawer</code> and add
a property drawer right below the current headline.  Completion over drawer
keywords is also possible using <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

   <p>Visibility cycling (see <a href="Visibility-cycling.html#Visibility-cycling">Visibility cycling</a>) on the headline will hide and
show the entry, but keep the drawer collapsed to a single line.  In order to
look inside the drawer, you need to move the cursor to the drawer line and
press &lt;TAB&gt; there.  Org mode uses the <code>PROPERTIES</code> drawer for
storing properties (see <a href="Properties-and-columns.html#Properties-and-columns">Properties and columns</a>), and you can also arrange
for state change notes (see <a href="Tracking-TODO-state-changes.html#Tracking-TODO-state-changes">Tracking TODO state changes</a>) and clock times
(see <a href="Clocking-work-time.html#Clocking-work-time">Clocking work time</a>) to be stored in a drawer <code>LOGBOOK</code>.  If you
want to store a quick note in the LOGBOOK drawer, in a similar way to state
changes, use

     
<a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dz-234"></a>
<dl><dt><kbd>C-c C-z</kbd><dd>Add a time-stamped note to the LOGBOOK drawer. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-org_002dexport_002dwith_002ddrawers-235"></a><a name="index-org_002dexport_002dwith_002dproperties-236"></a>You can select the name of the drawers which should be exported with
<code>org-export-with-drawers</code>.  In that case, drawer contents will appear in
export output.  Property drawers are not affected by this variable: configure
<code>org-export-with-properties</code> instead.

intercept <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> to switch windows.  Use <kbd>C-M-i</kbd> or
<kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> instead for completion (see <a href="Completion.html#Completion">Completion</a>).</p>
