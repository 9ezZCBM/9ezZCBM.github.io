<h4 class="subsection">15.12.3 Pulling from the mobile application</h4>

<p><a name="index-org_002dmobile_002dpull-2381"></a>The command <code>org-mobile-pull</code> synchronizes changes with the server. 
More specifically, it first pulls the Org files for viewing.  It then
appends captured entries and pointers to flagged or changed entries to
the file &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mobileorg.org</span></samp>&rsquo; on the server.  Org ultimately integrates its
data in an inbox file format, through the following steps:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li><a name="index-org_002dmobile_002dinbox_002dfor_002dpull-2382"></a>Org moves all entries found in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mobileorg.org</span></samp>&rsquo;<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> and appends
them to the file pointed to by the variable
<code>org-mobile-inbox-for-pull</code>.  It should reside neither in the
staging area nor on the server.  Each captured entry and each
editing event is a top-level entry in the inbox file.

     <li><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bFLAGGED_007d_002c-tag-2383"></a>After moving the entries, Org processes changes to the shared
files.  Some of them are applied directly and without user
interaction.  Examples include changes to tags, TODO state,
headline and body text.  Entries requiring further action are
tagged as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FLAGGED</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Org marks entries with problems with an error
message in the inbox.  They have to be resolved manually.

     <li>Org generates an agenda view for flagged entries for user
intervention to clean up.  For notes stored in flagged entries, Org
displays them in the echo area when point is on the corresponding
agenda item.

          <dl>
<dt><kbd>?</kbd><dd>Pressing <kbd>?</kbd> displays the entire flagged note in
another window.  Org also pushes it to the kill ring.  To
store flagged note as a normal note, use <kbd>? z C-y C-c C-c</kbd>.  Pressing <kbd>?</kbd> twice does these things: first
it removes the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FLAGGED</span></samp>&rsquo; tag; second, it removes the flagged
note from the property drawer; third, it signals that manual
editing of the flagged entry is now finished. 
</dl>
     </ol>

   <p><a name="index-g_t_003f-_0040r_007b_0028Agenda-dispatcher_0029_007d-2384"></a>From the agenda dispatcher, <kbd>?</kbd> returns to the view to finish
processing flagged entries.  Note that these entries may not be the
most recent since the mobile application searches files that were last
pulled.  To get an updated agenda view with changes since the last
pull, pull again.
