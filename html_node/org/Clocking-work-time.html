<h3 class="section">8.4 Clocking work time</h3>

<p><a name="index-clocking-time-892"></a><a name="index-time-clocking-893"></a>
Org mode allows you to clock the time you spend on specific tasks in a
project.  When you start working on an item, you can start the clock.  When
you stop working on that task, or when you mark the task done, the clock is
stopped and the corresponding time interval is recorded.  It also computes
the total time spent on each subtree<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> of a project. 
And it remembers a history or tasks recently clocked, so that you can jump
quickly between a number of tasks absorbing your time.

   <p>To save the clock history across Emacs sessions, use
<pre class="lisp">     (setq org-clock-persist 'history)
     (org-clock-persistence-insinuate)
</pre>
   <p>When you clock into a new task after resuming Emacs, the incomplete
clock<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>
will be found (see <a href="Resolving-idle-time.html#Resolving-idle-time">Resolving idle time</a>) and you will be prompted about
what to do with it.

headings are indented with less than 30 stars.  This is a hardcoded
limitation of <code>lmax</code> in <code>org-clock-sum</code>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> To resume the clock under the assumption that you have worked
on this task while outside Emacs, use <code>(setq org-clock-persist t)</code>.</p>
