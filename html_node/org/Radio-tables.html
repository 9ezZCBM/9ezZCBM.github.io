<h4 class="subsection">A.6.1 Radio tables</h4>

<p><a name="index-radio-tables-2397"></a>
Radio tables are target locations for translated tables that are not near
their source.  Org finds the target location and inserts the translated
table.

   <p>The key to finding the target location are the magic words <code>BEGIN/END
RECEIVE ORGTBL</code>.  They have to appear as comments in the current mode.  If
the mode is C, then:

<pre class="example">     /* BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL table_name */
     /* END RECEIVE ORGTBL table_name */
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">At the location of source, Org needs a special line to direct Orgtbl to
translate and to find the target for inserting the translated table.  For
example:
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_0023_002bORGTBL_007d-2398"></a>
<pre class="example">     #+ORGTBL: SEND table_name translation_function arguments...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><code>table_name</code> is the table's reference name, which is also used in the
receiver lines, and the <code>translation_function</code> is the Lisp function that
translates.  This line, in addition, may also contain alternating key and
value arguments at the end.  The translation function gets these values as a
property list.  A few standard parameters are already recognized and acted
upon before the translation function is called:

     <dl>
<dt><code>:skip N</code><dd>Skip the first N lines of the table.  Hlines do count; include them if they
are to be skipped.

     <br><dt><code>:skipcols (n1 n2 ...)</code><dd>List of columns to be skipped.  First Org automatically discards columns with
calculation marks and then sends the table to the translator function, which
then skips columns as specified in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">skipcols</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">To keep the source table intact in the buffer without being disturbed when
the source file is compiled or otherwise being worked on, use one of these
strategies:

     <ul>
<li>Place the table in a block comment.  For example, in C mode you could wrap
the table between &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/*</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*/</span></samp>&rsquo; lines. 
<li>Put the table after an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">END</span></samp>&rsquo; statement.  For example &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\bye</span></samp>&rsquo; in
TeX and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\end{document}</span></samp>&rsquo; in LaTeX. 
<li>Comment and uncomment each line of the table during edits.  The <kbd>M-x
orgtbl-toggle-comment &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> command makes toggling easy. 
</ul>
