<h4 class="subsection">13.3.2 Example: complex publishing configuration</h4>

<p>This more complicated example publishes an entire website, including
Org files converted to HTML, image files, Emacs Lisp source code, and
style sheets.  The publishing directory is remote and private files are
excluded.

   <p>To ensure that links are preserved, care should be taken to replicate
your directory structure on the web server, and to use relative file
paths.  For example, if your Org files are kept in <samp><span class="file">~/org</span></samp> and your
publishable images in <samp><span class="file">~/images</span></samp>, you would link to an image with
<pre class="example">     file:../images/myimage.png
</pre>
   <p>On the web server, the relative path to the image should be the
same.  You can accomplish this by setting up an "images" folder in the
right place on the web server, and publishing images to it.
