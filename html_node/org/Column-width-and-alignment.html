<h3 class="section">3.2 Column width and alignment</h3>

<p><a name="index-narrow-columns-in-tables-325"></a><a name="index-alignment-in-tables-326"></a>
The width of columns is automatically determined by the table editor.  And
also the alignment of a column is determined automatically from the fraction
of number-like versus non-number fields in the column.

   <p>Sometimes a single field or a few fields need to carry more text, leading to
inconveniently wide columns.  Or maybe you want to make a table with several
columns having a fixed width, regardless of content.  To set the width of
a column, one field anywhere in the column may contain just the string
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;N&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">N</span></samp>&rsquo; is an integer specifying the width of the column in
characters.  The next re-align will then set the width of this column to this
value.

<pre class="example">     |---+------------------------------|               |---+--------|
     |   |                              |               |   | &lt;6&gt;    |
     | 1 | one                          |               | 1 | one    |
     | 2 | two                          |     ----\     | 2 | two    |
     | 3 | This is a long chunk of text |     ----/     | 3 | This=&gt; |
     | 4 | four                         |               | 4 | four   |
     |---+------------------------------|               |---+--------|
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Fields that are wider become clipped and end in the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Note that the full text is still in the buffer but is hidden. 
To see the full text, hold the mouse over the field&mdash;a tool-tip window
will show the full content.  To edit such a field, use the command
<kbd>C-c `</kbd> (that is <kbd>C-c</kbd> followed by the grave accent).  This will
open a new window with the full field.  Edit it and finish with <kbd>C-c
C-c</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-org_002dstartup_002dalign_002dall_002dtables-327"></a>When visiting a file containing a table with narrowed columns, the
necessary character hiding has not yet happened, and the table needs to
be aligned before it looks nice.  Setting the option
<code>org-startup-align-all-tables</code> will realign all tables in a file
upon visiting, but also slow down startup.  You can also set this option
on a per-file basis with:

<pre class="example">     #+STARTUP: align
     #+STARTUP: noalign
</pre>
   <p>If you would like to overrule the automatic alignment of number-rich columns
to the right and of string-rich columns to the left, you can use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;r&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;c&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;l&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; in a similar fashion.  You may
also combine alignment and field width like this: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;r10&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.

automatically when exporting the document.
