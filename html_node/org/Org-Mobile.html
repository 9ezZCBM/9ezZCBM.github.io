<h3 class="section">15.12 Org Mobile</h3>

<p><a name="index-smartphone-2376"></a>
Org Mobile is a protocol for synchronizing Org files between Emacs and
other applications, e.g., on mobile devices.  It enables offline-views
and capture support for an Org mode system that is rooted on a &ldquo;real&rdquo;
computer.  The external application can also record changes to
existing entries.

   <p>This appendix describes Org's support for agenda view formats
compatible with Org Mobile.  It also describes synchronizing changes,
such as to notes, between the mobile application and the computer.

   <p>To change tags and TODO states in the mobile application, first
customize the variables <code>org-todo-keywords</code> and <code>org-tag-alist</code>. 
These should cover all the important tags and TODO keywords, even if
Org files use only some of them.  Though the mobile application is
expected to support in-buffer settings, it is required to understand
TODO states <em>sets</em> (see <a href="Per_002dfile-keywords.html#Per_002dfile-keywords">Per-file keywords</a>) and
<em>mutually exclusive</em> tags (see <a href="Setting-tags.html#Setting-tags">Setting tags</a>) only for those set in
these variables.
