If you find problems with Org, or if you have questions, remarks, or ideas
about it, please mail to the Org mailing list <a href="mailto:emacs-orgmode@gnu.org">emacs-orgmode@gnu.org</a>. 
You can subscribe to the list
<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-orgmode">on this web page</a>. 
If you are not a member of the mailing list, your mail will be passed to the
list after a moderator has approved it<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

   <p>For bug reports, please first try to reproduce the bug with the latest
version of Org available&mdash;if you are running an outdated version, it is
quite possible that the bug has been fixed already.  If the bug persists,
prepare a report and provide as much information as possible, including the
version information of Emacs (<kbd>M-x emacs-version &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>) and Org
(<kbd>M-x org-version &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>), as well as the Org related setup in the
Emacs init file.  The easiest way to do this is to use the command
<pre class="example">     <kbd>M-x org-submit-bug-report &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which will put all this information into an Emacs mail buffer so
that you only need to add your description.  If you are not sending the Email
from within Emacs, please copy and paste the content into your Email program.

   <p>Sometimes you might face a problem due to an error in your Emacs or Org mode
setup.  Before reporting a bug, it is very helpful to start Emacs with minimal
customizations and reproduce the problem.  Doing so often helps you determine
if the problem is with your customization or with Org mode itself.  You can
start a typical minimal session with a command like the example below.

<pre class="example">     $ emacs -Q -l /path/to/minimal-org.el
</pre>
   <p>However if you are using Org mode as distributed with Emacs, a minimal setup
is not necessary.  In that case it is sufficient to start Emacs as
<code>emacs -Q</code>.  The <code>minimal-org.el</code> setup file can have contents as
shown below.

<pre class="lisp">     ;;; Minimal setup to load latest 'org-mode'
     
     ;; activate debugging
     (setq debug-on-error t
           debug-on-signal nil
           debug-on-quit nil)
     
     ;; add latest org-mode to load path
     (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/org-mode/lisp")
     (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/org-mode/contrib/lisp" t)
</pre>
   <p>If an error occurs, a backtrace can be very useful (see below on how to
create one).  Often a small example file helps, along with clear information
about:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>What exactly did you do? 
<li>What did you expect to happen? 
<li>What happened instead?
        </ol>
Thank you for helping to improve this program.

<h5 class="subsubheading">How to create a useful backtrace</h5>

<p><a name="index-backtrace-of-an-error-21"></a>If working with Org produces an error with a message you don't
understand, you may have hit a bug.  The best way to report this is by
providing, in addition to what was mentioned above, a <em>backtrace</em>. 
This is information from the built-in debugger about where and how the
error occurred.  Here is how to produce a useful backtrace:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Reload uncompiled versions of all Org mode Lisp files.  The backtrace
contains much more information if it is produced with uncompiled code. 
To do this, use
     <pre class="example">          <kbd>C-u M-x org-reload &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">or select <code>Org -&gt; Refresh/Reload -&gt; Reload Org uncompiled</code> from the
menu. 
<li>Go to the <code>Options</code> menu and select <code>Enter Debugger on Error</code>. 
<li>Do whatever you have to do to hit the error.  Don't forget to
document the steps you take. 
<li>When you hit the error, a <samp><span class="file">*Backtrace*</span></samp> buffer will appear on the
screen.  Save this buffer to a file (for example using <kbd>C-x C-w</kbd>) and
attach it to your bug report.
