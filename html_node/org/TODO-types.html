<h4 class="subsection">5.2.2 TODO keywords as types</h4>

<p><a name="index-TODO-types-561"></a><a name="index-names-as-TODO-keywords-562"></a><a name="index-types-as-TODO-keywords-563"></a>
The second possibility is to use TODO keywords to indicate different
<em>types</em> of action items.  For example, you might want to indicate
that items are for &ldquo;work&rdquo; or &ldquo;home&rdquo;.  Or, when you work with several
people on a single project, you might want to assign action items
directly to persons, by using their names as TODO keywords.  This would
be set up like this:

<pre class="lisp">     (setq org-todo-keywords '((type "Fred" "Sara" "Lucy" "|" "DONE")))
</pre>
   <p>In this case, different keywords do not indicate a sequence, but rather
different types.  So the normal work flow would be to assign a task to
a person, and later to mark it DONE.  Org mode supports this style by
adapting the workings of the command <kbd>C-c C-t</kbd><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  When used several times in
succession, it will still cycle through all names, in order to first select
the right type for a task.  But when you return to the item after some time
and execute <kbd>C-c C-t</kbd> again, it will switch from any name directly to
DONE.  Use prefix arguments or completion to quickly select a specific name. 
You can also review the items of a specific TODO type in a sparse tree by
using a numeric prefix to <kbd>C-c / t</kbd>.  For example, to see all things Lucy
has to do, you would use <kbd>C-3 C-c / t</kbd>.  To collect Lucy's items from all
agenda files into a single buffer, you would use the numeric prefix argument
as well when creating the global TODO list: <kbd>C-3 C-c a t</kbd>.

   <div class="footnote">
<hr>
<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> This is also true
for the <kbd>t</kbd> command in the agenda buffers.</p>

   <hr></div>
