<h3 class="section">12.4 Include files</h3>

<p><a name="index-include-files_002c-during-export-1669"></a>Include other files during export.  For example, to include your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>
file, you could use:
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_0023_002bINCLUDE_007d-1670"></a>
<pre class="example">     #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" src emacs-lisp
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first parameter is the file name to include.  The optional second
parameter specifies the block type: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">example</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">export</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">src</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The optional third parameter specifies the source code language
to use for formatting the contents.  This is relevant to both &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">export</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">src</span></samp>&rsquo; block types.

   <p>If an include file is specified as having a markup language, Org neither
checks for valid syntax nor changes the contents in any way.  For
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">example</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">src</span></samp>&rsquo; blocks, Org code-escapes the contents before
inclusion.

   <p>If an include file is not specified as having any markup language, Org
assumes it be in Org format and proceeds as usual with a few exceptions.  Org
makes the footnote labels (see <a href="Footnotes.html#Footnotes">Footnotes</a>) in the included file local to
that file.  The contents of the included file will belong to the same
structure&mdash;headline, item&mdash;containing the <code>INCLUDE</code> keyword.  In
particular, headlines within the file will become children of the current
section.  That behavior can be changed by providing an additional keyword
parameter, <code>:minlevel</code>.  It shifts the headlines in the included file to
become the lowest level.  For example, this syntax makes the included file
a sibling of the current top-level headline:

<pre class="example">     #+INCLUDE: "~/my-book/chapter2.org" :minlevel 1
</pre>
   <p>Inclusion of only portions of files are specified using ranges parameter with
<code>:lines</code> keyword.  The line at the upper end of the range will not be
included.  The start and/or the end of the range may be omitted to use the
obvious defaults.

<pre class="example">     #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" :lines "5-10"   <span class="roman">Include lines 5 to 10, 10 excluded</span>
     #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" :lines "-10"    <span class="roman">Include lines 1 to 10, 10 excluded</span>
     #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" :lines "10-"    <span class="roman">Include lines from 10 to EOF</span>
</pre>
   <p>Inclusions may specify a file-link to extract an object matched by
<code>org-link-search</code><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>  (see <a href="Search-options.html#Search-options">Search options</a>).

   <p>To extract only the contents of the matched object, set <code>:only-contents</code>
property to non-<code>nil</code>.  This will omit any planning lines or property
drawers.  The ranges for <code>:lines</code> keyword are relative to the requested
element.  Some examples:

<pre class="example">     #+INCLUDE: "./paper.org::#theory" :only-contents t
        <span class="roman">Include the body of the heading with the custom id &lsquo;</span><samp><span class="samp">theory</span></samp><span class="roman">&rsquo;</span>
     #+INCLUDE: "./paper.org::mytable"  <span class="roman">Include named element.</span>
     #+INCLUDE: "./paper.org::*conclusion" :lines 1-20
        <span class="roman">Include the first 20 lines of the headline named &lsquo;</span><samp><span class="samp">conclusion</span></samp><span class="roman">&rsquo;.</span>
</pre>
