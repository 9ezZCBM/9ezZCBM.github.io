<h3 class="section">5.2 Low-Level Functions for Working with Tests</h3>

<p><a name="index-low_002dlevel-functions-51"></a>
Both <code>ert-run-tests-interactively</code> and <code>ert-run-tests-batch</code>
are implemented on top of the lower-level test handling code in the
sections of <samp><span class="file">ert.el</span></samp> labeled &ldquo;Facilities for running a single test&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Test selectors&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Facilities for running a whole set of tests&rdquo;.

   <p>If you want to write code that works with ERT tests, you should take a
look at this lower-level code.  Symbols that start with <code>ert--</code>
are internal to ERT, whereas those that start with <code>ert-</code> are
meant to be usable by other code.  But there is no mature API yet.

   <p>Contributions to ERT are welcome.
