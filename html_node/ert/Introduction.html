<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p><a name="index-introduction-to-ERT-1"></a>
ERT allows you to define <em>tests</em> in addition to functions,
macros, variables, and the other usual Lisp constructs.  Tests are
simply Lisp code: code that invokes other code and checks whether
it behaves as expected.

   <p>ERT keeps track of the tests that are defined and provides convenient
commands to run them to verify whether the definitions that are
currently loaded in Emacs pass the tests.

   <p>Some Lisp files have comments like the following (adapted from the
package <code>pp.el</code>):

<pre class="lisp">     ;; (pp-to-string '(quote quote))          ; expected: "'quote"
     ;; (pp-to-string '((quote a) (quote b)))  ; expected: "('a 'b)\n"
     ;; (pp-to-string '('a 'b))                ; same as above
</pre>
   <p>The code contained in these comments can be evaluated from time to
time to compare the output with the expected output.  ERT formalizes
this and introduces a common convention, which simplifies Emacs
development, since programmers no longer have to manually find and
evaluate such comments.

   <p>An ERT test definition equivalent to the above comments is this:

<pre class="lisp">     (ert-deftest pp-test-quote ()
       "Tests the rendering of `quote' symbols in `pp-to-string'."
       (should (equal (pp-to-string '(quote quote)) "'quote"))
       (should (equal (pp-to-string '((quote a) (quote b))) "('a 'b)\n"))
       (should (equal (pp-to-string '('a 'b)) "('a 'b)\n")))
</pre>
   <p>If you know <code>defun</code>, the syntax of <code>ert-deftest</code> should look
familiar: This example defines a test named <code>pp-test-quote</code> that
will pass if the three calls to <code>equal</code> all return non-<code>nil</code>.

   <p><code>should</code> is a macro with the same meaning as <code>cl-assert</code> but
better error reporting.  See <a href="The-_003ccode_003eshould_003c_002fcode_003e-Macro.html#The-_003ccode_003eshould_003c_002fcode_003e-Macro">The <code>should</code> Macro</a>.

   <p>Each test should have a name that describes what functionality it tests. 
Test names can be chosen arbitrarily&mdash;they are in a
namespace separate from functions and variables&mdash;but should follow
the usual Emacs Lisp convention of having a prefix that indicates
which package they belong to.  Test names are displayed by ERT when
reporting failures and can be used when selecting which tests to run.

   <p>The empty parentheses <code>()</code> in the first line don't currently have
any meaning and are reserved for future extension.  They also make
the syntax of <code>ert-deftest</code> more similar to that of <code>defun</code>.

   <p>The docstring describes what feature this test tests.  When running
tests interactively, the first line of the docstring is displayed for
tests that fail, so it is good if the first line makes sense on its
own.

   <p>The body of a test can be arbitrary Lisp code.  It should have as few
side effects as possible; each test should be written to clean up
after itself, leaving Emacs in the same state as it was before the
test.  Tests should clean up even if they fail.  See <a href="Tests-and-Their-Environment.html#Tests-and-Their-Environment">Tests and Their Environment</a>.
