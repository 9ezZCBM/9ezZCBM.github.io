<h3 class="section">3.2 Expected Failures</h3>

<p><a name="index-expected-failures-28"></a><a name="index-known-bugs-29"></a>
<a name="index-g_t_003aexpected_002dresult-30"></a>Some bugs are complicated to fix, or not very important, and are left as
<em>known bugs</em>.  If there is a test case that triggers the bug and
fails, ERT will alert you of this failure every time you run all
tests.  For known bugs, this alert is a distraction.  The way to
suppress it is to add <code>:expected-result :failed</code> to the test
definition:

<pre class="lisp">     (ert-deftest future-bug ()
       "Test `time-forward' with negative arguments.
     Since this functionality isn't implemented, the test is known to fail."
       :expected-result :failed
       (time-forward -1))
</pre>
   <p>ERT will still display a small <code>f</code> in the progress bar as a
reminder that there is a known bug, and will count the test as failed,
but it will be quiet about it otherwise.

   <p>An alternative to marking the test as a known failure this way is to
delete the test.  This is a good idea if there is no intent to fix it,
i.e., if the behavior that was formerly considered a bug has become an
accepted feature.

   <p>In general, however, it can be useful to keep tests that are known to
fail.  If someone wants to fix the bug, they will have a very good
starting point: an automated test case that reproduces the bug.  This
makes it much easier to fix the bug, demonstrate that it is fixed, and
prevent future regressions.

   <p>ERT displays the same kind of alerts for tests that pass unexpectedly
as it displays for unexpected failures.  This way, if you make code
changes that happen to fix a bug that you weren't aware of, you will
know to remove the <code>:expected-result</code> clause of that test and
close the corresponding bug report, if any.

   <p>Since <code>:expected-result</code> evaluates its argument when the test is
loaded, tests can be marked as known failures only on certain Emacs
versions, specific architectures, etc.:

<pre class="lisp">     (ert-deftest foo ()
       "A test that is expected to fail on Emacs 23 but succeed elsewhere."
       :expected-result (if (string-match "GNU Emacs 23[.]" (emacs-version))
                            :failed
                          :passed)
       ...)
</pre>
