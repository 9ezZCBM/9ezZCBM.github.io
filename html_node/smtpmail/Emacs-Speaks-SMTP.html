<h2 class="chapter">2 Emacs Speaks SMTP</h2>

<p>Emacs includes a package for sending your mail to a SMTP server and
have it take care of delivering it to the final destination, rather
than letting the MTA on your local system take care of it.  This can
be useful if you don't have a MTA set up on your host, or if your
machine is often disconnected from the internet.

   <p>Sending mail via SMTP requires configuring your mail user agent
(see <a href="../emacs/Mail-Methods.html#Mail-Methods">Mail Methods</a>) to use the SMTP library.  If you
have not configured anything, then in Emacs 24.1 and later the first
time you try to send a mail Emacs will ask how you want to send
mail.  To use this library, answer &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">smtp</span></samp>&rsquo; when prompted.  Emacs
then asks for the name of the SMTP server.

   <p>If you prefer, or if you are using a non-standard mail user agent,
you can configure this yourself.  The normal way to do this is to set
the variable <code>send-mail-function</code> (see <a href="../emacs/Mail-Sending.html#Mail-Sending">Mail Sending</a>) to the value you want to use.  To use this library:

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The default value for this variable is <code>sendmail-query-once</code>,
which interactively asks how you want to send mail.

   <p>Your mail user agent might use a different variable for this purpose. 
It should inherit from <code>send-mail-function</code>, but if it does not,
or if you prefer, you can set that variable directly.  Consult your
mail user agent's documentation for more details.  For example,
(see <a href="../message/Mail-Variables.html#Mail-Variables">Mail Variables</a>).

   <p>Before using SMTP you must find out the hostname of the SMTP server
to use.  Your system administrator or mail service provider should
supply this information.  Often it is some variant of the server you
receive mail from.  If your email address is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">yourname@example.com</span></samp>&rsquo;, then the name of the SMTP server is
may be something like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">smtp.example.com</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <dl>
<dt><code>smtpmail-smtp-server</code><dd><a name="index-smtpmail_002dsmtp_002dserver-9"></a><a name="index-SMTPSERVER-10"></a>  The variable <code>smtpmail-smtp-server</code> controls the hostname of
the server to use.  It is a string with an IP address or hostname.  It
defaults to the contents of the <samp><span class="env">SMTPSERVER</span></samp> environment
variable, or, if empty, the contents of
<code>smtpmail-default-smtp-server</code>.

     <br><dt><code>smtpmail-default-smtp-server</code><dd><a name="index-smtpmail_002ddefault_002dsmtp_002dserver-11"></a>  The variable <code>smtpmail-default-smtp-server</code> controls the
default hostname of the server to use.  It is a string with an IP
address or hostname.  It must be set before the SMTP library is
loaded.  It has no effect if set after the SMTP library has been
loaded, or if <code>smtpmail-smtp-server</code> is defined.  It is usually
set by system administrators in a site wide initialization file. 
</dl>

   <p>The following example illustrates what you could put in
<samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> to set the SMTP server name.

<pre class="example">     ;; Send mail using SMTP via mail.example.org.
     (setq smtpmail-smtp-server "mail.example.org")
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-Mail-Submission-12"></a>SMTP is normally used on the registered &ldquo;smtp&rdquo; TCP service port 25. 
Some environments use SMTP in &ldquo;Mail Submission&rdquo; mode, which uses
port 587.  Using other ports is not uncommon, either for security by
obscurity purposes, port forwarding, or otherwise.

     <dl>
<dt><code>smtpmail-smtp-service</code><dd><a name="index-smtpmail_002dsmtp_002dservice-13"></a>  The variable <code>smtpmail-smtp-service</code> controls the port on the
server to contact.  It is either a string, in which case it will be
translated into an integer using system calls, or an integer. 
</dl>

   <p>The following example illustrates what you could put in
<samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> to set the SMTP service port.

<pre class="example">     ;; Send mail using SMTP on the mail submission port 587.
     (setq smtpmail-smtp-service 587)
</pre>
   </body></html>
