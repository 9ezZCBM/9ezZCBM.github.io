<h2 class="chapter">3 Authentication</h2>

<p><a name="index-password-14"></a><a name="index-user-name-15"></a>Most SMTP servers require clients to authenticate themselves before
they are allowed to send mail.  Authentication usually involves
supplying a user name and password.

   <p>If you have not configured anything, then the first time you try to
send mail via a server, Emacs (version 24.1 and later) prompts you
for the user name and password to use, and then offers to save the
information.  By default, Emacs stores authentication information in
a file <samp><span class="file">~/.authinfo</span></samp>.

   <p><a name="index-authinfo-16"></a>The basic format of the <samp><span class="file">~/.authinfo</span></samp> file is one line for each
set of credentials.  Each line consists of pairs of variables and
values.  A simple example would be:

<pre class="smallexample">     machine mail.example.org port 25 login myuser password mypassword
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This specifies that when using the SMTP server called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mail.example.org</span></samp>&rsquo;
on port 25, Emacs should send the user name &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">myuser</span></samp>&rsquo; and the
password &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mypassword</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Either or both of the login and password
fields may be absent, in which case Emacs prompts for the information
when you try to send mail.  (This replaces the old
<code>smtpmail-auth-credentials</code> variable used prior to Emacs 24.1.)

   <p><a name="index-smtpmail_002dsmtp_002duser-17"></a>  When the SMTP library connects to a host on a certain port, it
searches the <samp><span class="file">~/.authinfo</span></samp> file for a matching entry.  If an
entry is found, the authentication process is invoked and the
credentials are used.  If the variable <code>smtpmail-smtp-user</code> is
set to a non-<code>nil</code> value, then only entries for that user are
considered.  For more information on the <samp><span class="file">~/.authinfo</span></samp>
file, see <a href="../auth/index.html#Top">auth-source</a>.

   <p><a name="index-SASL-18"></a><a name="index-CRAM_002dMD5-19"></a><a name="index-PLAIN-20"></a><a name="index-LOGIN-21"></a>The process by which the SMTP library authenticates you to the server
is known as &ldquo;Simple Authentication and Security Layer&rdquo; (SASL). 
There are various SASL mechanisms, and this library supports three of
them: CRAM-MD5, PLAIN, and LOGIN.  It tries each of them, in that order,
until one succeeds.  The first uses a form of encryption to obscure
your password, while the other two do not.
