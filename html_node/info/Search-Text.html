<h3 class="section">2.1 <kbd>s</kbd> searches Info documents</h3>

<p><a name="index-searching-Info-documents-59"></a><a name="index-Info-document-as-a-reference-60"></a>  The commands which move between and inside nodes allow you to read
the entire manual or its large portions.  But what if you need to find
some information in the manual as fast as you can, and you don't know
or don't remember in what node to look for it?  This need arises when
you use a manual as a <dfn>reference</dfn>, or when it is impractical to
read the entire manual before you start using the programs it
describes.

   <p>Info has powerful searching facilities that let you find things
quickly.  You can search either the manual text or its indices.

   <p><a name="index-s-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-61"></a><a name="index-Info_002dsearch-62"></a>  The <kbd>s</kbd> command allows you to search a whole Info file for a string. 
It switches to the next node if and when that is necessary.  You
type <kbd>s</kbd> followed by the string to search for, terminated by
&lt;RET&gt;.  To search for the same string again, just <kbd>s</kbd> followed
by &lt;RET&gt; will do.  The file's nodes are scanned in the order
they are in the file, which has no necessary relationship to the
order that they may be in the tree structure of menus and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">next</span></samp>&rsquo;
pointers.  But normally the two orders are not very different.  In any
case, you can always look at the mode line to find out what node you have
reached, if the header is not visible (this can happen, because <kbd>s</kbd>
puts your cursor at the occurrence of the string, not at the beginning
of the node).

   <p><a name="index-C_002ds-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-63"></a><a name="index-C_002dr-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-64"></a><a name="index-isearch-65"></a>  Instead of using <kbd>s</kbd> in Emacs Info and in the stand-alone Info,
you can use an incremental search started with <kbd>C-s</kbd> or <kbd>C-r</kbd>. 
It can search through multiple Info nodes.  See <a href="../emacs/Incremental-Search.html#Incremental-Search">Incremental Search</a>.  In Emacs, you can disable this behavior
by setting the variable <code>Info-isearch-search</code> to <code>nil</code>
(see <a href="Emacs-Info-Variables.html#Emacs-Info-Variables">Emacs Info Variables</a>).
