<h3 class="section">2.2 <kbd>i</kbd> searches the indices for specific subjects</h3>

<p><a name="index-searching-Info-indices-66"></a><a name="index-i-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-67"></a><a name="index-Info_002dindex-68"></a>  Since most topics in the manual should be indexed, you should try
the index search first before the text search.  The <kbd>i</kbd> command
prompts you for a subject and then looks up that subject in the
indices.  If it finds an index entry with the subject you typed, it
goes to the node to which that index entry points.  You should browse
through that node to see whether the issue you are looking for is
described there.  If it isn't, type <kbd>,</kbd> one or more times to go
through additional index entries which match your subject.

   <p>The <kbd>i</kbd> command and subsequent <kbd>,</kbd> commands find all index
entries which include the string you typed <em>as a substring</em>. 
For each match, Info shows in the echo area the full index entry it
found.  Often, the text of the full index entry already gives you
enough information to decide whether it is relevant to what you are
looking for, so we recommend that you read what Info shows in the echo
area before looking at the node it displays.

   <p>Since <kbd>i</kbd> looks for a substring, you can search for subjects even
if you are not sure how they are spelled in the index.  For example,
suppose you want to find something that is pertinent to commands which
complete partial input (e.g., when you type &lt;TAB&gt;).  If you want
to catch index entries that refer to &ldquo;complete,&rdquo; &ldquo;completion,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;completing,&rdquo; you could type <kbd>icomplet&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.

   <p>Info documents which describe programs should index the commands,
options, and key sequences that the program provides.  If you are
looking for a description of a command, an option, or a key, just type
their names when <kbd>i</kbd> prompts you for a topic.  For example, if you
want to read the description of what the <kbd>C-l</kbd> key does, type
<kbd>iC-l&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> literally.

   <p><a name="index-Info_002dvirtual_002dindex-69"></a><a name="index-I-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-70"></a>Emacs provides the command <code>Info-virtual-index</code>, bound to the
<kbd>I</kbd> key.  This behaves like <kbd>i</kbd>, but constructs a virtual
info node displaying the results of an index search, making it easier
to select the one you want.

   <p><a name="index-info_002dapropos-71"></a><a name="index-index_002dapropos-72"></a>If you aren't sure which manual documents the topic you are looking
for, try the <kbd>M-x info-apropos</kbd> command in Emacs, or the <kbd>M-x
index-apropos</kbd> command in the stand-alone reader.  It prompts for
a string and then looks up that string in all the indices of all the
Info documents installed on your system.
