     <dl>
<dt>BNF<dd>In semantic 1.4, a BNF file represented &ldquo;Bovine Normal Form&rdquo;, the
grammar file used for the 1.4 parser generator.  This was a play on
Backus-Naur Form which proved too confusing.

     <br><dt>bovinate<dd>A verb representing what happens when a bovine parser parses a file.

     <br><dt>bovine lambda<dd>In a bovine, or LL parser, the bovine lambda is a function to execute
when a specific set of match rules has succeeded in matching text from
the buffer.

     <br><dt>bovine parser<dd>A parser using the bovine parser generator.  It is an LL parser
suitable for small simple languages.

     <br><dt>context
<br><dt>LALR
<br><dt>lexer<dd>A program which converts text into a stream of tokens by analyzing
them lexically.  Lexers will commonly create strings, symbols,
keywords and punctuation, and strip whitespaces and comments.

     <br><dt>LL
<br><dt>nonterminal<dd>A nonterminal symbol or simply a nonterminal stands for a class of
syntactically equivalent groupings.  A nonterminal symbol name is used
in writing grammar rules.

     <br><dt>overloadable<dd>Some functions are defined via <code>define-overload</code>. 
These can be overloaded via ....

     <br><dt>parser<dd>A program that converts <b>tokens</b> to <b>tags</b>.

     <br><dt>tag<dd>A tag is a representation of some entity in a language file, such as a
function, variable, or include statement.  In semantic, the word tag is
used the same way it is used for the etags or ctags tools.

     <p>A tag is usually bound to a buffer region via overlay, or it just
specifies character locations in a file.

     <br><dt>token<dd>A single atomic item returned from a lexer.  It represents some set
of characters found in a buffer.

     <br><dt>token stream<dd>The output of the lexer as well as the input to the parser.

     <br><dt>wisent parser<dd>A parser using the wisent parser generator.  It is a port of bison to
Emacs Lisp.  It is an LALR parser suitable for complex languages.
