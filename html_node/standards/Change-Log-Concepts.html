<h4 class="subsection">6.8.1 Change Log Concepts</h4>

<a name="index-change-set"></a>
<a name="index-batch-of-changes"></a>
<p>You can think of the change log as a conceptual &ldquo;undo list&rdquo; which
states how earlier versions were different from the current version.
People can see the current version; they don&rsquo;t need the change log to
tell them what is in it.  What they want from a change log is a clear
explanation of how the earlier version differed.  Each <em>entry</em> in
a change log describes either an individual change or the smallest
batch of changes that belong together, also known as a <em>change
set</em>.
</p>
<a name="index-title_002c-change-log-entry"></a>
<a name="index-description_002c-change-log-entry"></a>
<p>It is a good idea to start the change log entry with a description
of the overall change.  This should be as long as needed to give
a clear description.
</p>
<p>Then give a list of names of the entities or definitions that you
changed, according to the files they are in, and what was changed
in each one.  See <a href="Style-of-Change-Logs.html#Style-of-Change-Logs">Style of Change Logs</a>.
</p>
<p>The change log file is normally called <samp>ChangeLog</samp> and covers an
entire directory.  Each directory can have its own change log, or a
directory can use the change log of its parent directory&mdash;it&rsquo;s up to
you.
</p>
<p>Instead of using a file named <samp>ChangeLog</samp>, you can record the
change log information as log entries in a version control system such
as RCS or CVS.  This can be converted automatically to a
<samp>ChangeLog</samp> file using <code>rcs2log</code>; in Emacs, the command
<kbd>C-x v a</kbd> (<code>vc-update-change-log</code>) does the job.
</p>
<p>The best place to explain how parts of the new code work with other code
is in comments in the code, not in the change log.
</p>
<p>If you think that a change calls for explanation of <em>why</em> the
change was needed&mdash;that is, what problem the old code had such that
it required this change&mdash;you&rsquo;re probably right.  Please put the
explanation in comments in the code, where people will see it whenever
they see the code.  An example of such an explanation is, &ldquo;This
function used to be iterative, but that failed when MUMBLE was a
tree.&rdquo;  (Though such a simple reason would not need this kind of
explanation.)
</p>
<p>The best place for other kinds of explanation of the change is in the
change log entry.
</p>
<p>The easiest way to add an entry to <samp>ChangeLog</samp> is with the Emacs
command <kbd>M-x add-change-log-entry</kbd>.  An individual change should
have an asterisk, the name of the changed file, and then in
parentheses the name of the changed functions, variables or whatever,
followed by a colon.  Then describe the changes you made to that
function or variable.
