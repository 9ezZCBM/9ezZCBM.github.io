<h2 class="chapter">7 Customization</h2>

<p>Ediff has a rather self-explanatory interface, and in most cases you
won't need to change anything.  However, should the need arise, there are
extensive facilities for changing the default behavior.

   <p>Most of the customization can be done by setting various variables in the
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.  Some customization (mostly window-related
customization and faces) can be done by putting appropriate lines in
<samp><span class="file">.Xdefaults</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">.xrdb</span></samp>, or whatever X resource file is in use.

   <p>With respect to the latter, please note that the X resource
for Ediff customization is &ldquo;Ediff&rdquo;, <em>not</em> &ldquo;emacs&rdquo;. 
See <a href="Window-and-Frame-Configuration.html#Window-and-Frame-Configuration">Window and Frame Configuration</a>,
See <a href="Highlighting-Difference-Regions.html#Highlighting-Difference-Regions">Highlighting Difference Regions</a>, for further details.  Please also
refer to Emacs manual for the information on how to set Emacs X resources.
