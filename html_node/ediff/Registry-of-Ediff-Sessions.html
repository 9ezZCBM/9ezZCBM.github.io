<h2 class="chapter">4 Registry of Ediff Sessions</h2>

<p>Ediff maintains a registry of all its invocations that are
still <em>active</em>.  This feature is very convenient for switching among
active Ediff sessions or for quickly restarting a suspended Ediff session.

   <p>The focal point of this activity is a buffer
called <em>*Ediff Registry*</em>.  You can display this buffer by typing
<kbd>R</kbd> in any Ediff Control Buffer or Session Group Buffer
(see <a href="Session-Groups.html#Session-Groups">Session Groups</a>), or by typing
<kbd>M-x eregistry</kbd> into the Minibuffer. 
The latter would be the fastest way to bring up the registry
buffer if no control or group buffer is displayed in any of the visible
Emacs windows. 
If you are in a habit of running multiple long Ediff sessions and often need to
suspend, resume, or switch between them, it may be a good idea to have the
registry buffer permanently displayed in a separate, dedicated window.

   <p>The registry buffer has several convenient key bindings. 
For instance, clicking mouse button 2 or typing
<kbd>RET</kbd> or <kbd>v</kbd> over any session record resumes that session. 
Session records in the registry buffer provide a fairly complete
description of each session, so it is usually easy to identify the right
session to resume.

   <p>Other useful commands are bound to <kbd>SPC</kbd> (next registry record)
and <kbd>DEL</kbd> (previous registry record).  There are other commands as well,
but you don't need to memorize them, since they are listed at the top of
the registry buffer.
