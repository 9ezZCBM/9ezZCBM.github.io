The article <a href="http://www.newt.com/faq/mh.html"><cite>MH Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) with Answers</cite></a> appears monthly in the newsgroup
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">comp.mail.mh</span></samp>&rsquo;. While very little is there that deals with MH-E
specifically, there is an incredible wealth of material about MH
itself which you will find useful.

   <p><a name="index-support-2227"></a>
You can find FAQs on MH-E by searching for <i>labels:support</i> on the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/mh-e/bugs/search/?q=labels%3Asupport">Tickets</a> page on SourceForge. If you don't find the answer to your
question, file a ticket and your question will become a new FAQ!
