<h3 class="section">6.5 Signed and Encrypted Messages</h3>

<p><a name="index-GPG-652"></a><a name="index-GnuPG-653"></a><a name="index-Gnus-654"></a><a name="index-OpenPGP-655"></a><a name="index-PGP-656"></a><a name="index-RFC-3156-657"></a><a name="index-encrypted-messages-658"></a><a name="index-security-659"></a><a name="index-signed-messages-660"></a>
You can read encrypted or signed PGP or GPG messages with
MH-E<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. This section assumes that you already have a good
understanding of GPG and have set up your keys appropriately.

   <p>If someone sends you a signed message, here is what you'll see:

<pre class="smallexample">     [[PGP Signed Part:Bill Wohler &lt;wohler@stop.mail-abuse.org&gt;]]
     This is a signed message.
     
     [[End of PGP Signed Part]]
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-keychain-661"></a><a name="index-key-server-662"></a><a name="index-signed-messages-663"></a>
If the key for the given signature is not in your keychain, you'll be
given the opportunity to fetch the key from a key server and verify
the key. If the message is really large, the verification process can
take a long time. You can press <kbd>C-g</kbd> at any time to
cancel<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>.

   <p>If the signature doesn't check out, you might see something like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     [[PGP Signed Part:Failed]]
     This is a signed message.
     This is garbage added after the signature was made.
     
     [[End of PGP Signed Part]]
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-decrypting-messages-664"></a>
If someone sends you an encrypted message, MH-E will ask for your
passphrase to decrypt the message. You should see something like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     [[PGP Encrypted Part:OK]]
     
     [[PGP Signed Part:Bill Wohler &lt;wohler@stop.mail-abuse.org&gt;]]
     This is the secret message.
     
     [[End of PGP Signed Part]]
     
     [[End of PGP Encrypted Part]]
</pre>
   <p>If there is a problem decrypting the message, the button will say:

<pre class="smallexample">     [[PGP Encrypted Part:Failed]]
</pre>
   <p>You can read the contents of this button using the methods described in
<a href="Viewing-Attachments.html#Viewing-Attachments">Viewing Attachments</a>. If the message were corrupted, you'd see
this:

<pre class="smallexample">     [[PGP Encrypted Part:Failed]
     Invalid base64 data]
</pre>
   <p>If your passphrase were incorrect, you'd see something like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     [GNUPG:] ENC_TO CD9C88BB610BD9AD 1 0
     [GNUPG:] USERID_HINT CD9C88BB610BD9AD Bill Wohler &lt;wohler@stop.mail-abuse.org&gt;
     [GNUPG:] NEED_PASSPHRASE CD9C88BB610BD9AD CD9C88BB610BD9AD 1 0
     [GNUPG:] BAD_PASSPHRASE CD9C88BB610BD9AD
     gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit RSA key, ID 610BD9AD, created 1997-09-09
           "Bill Wohler &lt;wohler@stop.mail-abuse.org&gt;"
     gpg: public key decryption failed: bad passphrase
     [GNUPG:] BEGIN_DECRYPTION
     [GNUPG:] DECRYPTION_FAILED
     gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
     [GNUPG:] END_DECRYPTION
     
     gpg exited abnormally: '2'
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-mh_002dshow_002dpgg_002dbad-665"></a><a name="index-mh_002dshow_002dpgg_002dgood-666"></a><a name="index-mh_002dshow_002dpgg_002dunknown-667"></a>
The appearance of the buttons is controlled by the faces
<code>mh-show-pgg-good</code>, <code>mh-show-pgg-bad</code>, and
<code>mh-show-pgg-unknown</code> depending on the validity of the signature. 
The latter is used whether the signature is unknown or untrusted.

The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pgg</span></samp>&rsquo; customization group may have some settings which may
interest you.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> This feature depends on post-5.10 versions of Gnus. 
<cite>MIME Security with OpenPGP</cite> is documented in
<a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3156.txt">RFC 3156</a>. However,
MH-E can also decrypt old-style PGP messages that are not in MIME
format.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> Unfortunately in the current version, the validation
process doesn't display a message so it appears that MH-E has hung. We
hope that this will be fixed in the future.</p>
