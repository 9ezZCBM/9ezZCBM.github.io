This manual introduces another interface to the MH mail system that is
accessible through the GNU Emacs editor, namely, <em>MH-E</em>. MH-E is
easy to use. I don't assume that you know GNU Emacs or even MH at this
point, since I didn't know either of them when I discovered MH-E. 
However, MH-E was the tip of the iceberg, and I discovered more and
more niceties about GNU Emacs and MH. Now I'm fully hooked on both of
them.

   <p>The MH-E package is distributed with Emacs<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, so you
shouldn't have to do anything special to use it. Gnus is also
required; version 5.10 or higher is recommended. This manual covers
MH-E version 8.6. To help you decide which version you
have, see <a href="Getting-Started.html#Getting-Started">Getting Started</a>.

   <p><a name="index-help_002dwith_002dtutorial-4"></a><a name="index-C_002dh-t-5"></a>
If you don't already use GNU Emacs but want to learn more, you can
read a built-in tutorial by starting GNU Emacs and typing <kbd>C-h t</kbd>
(<code>help-with-tutorial</code>). (To learn about this notation, see
<a href="Conventions.html#Conventions">Conventions</a>.) If you want to take the plunge, consult the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/"><cite>GNU Emacs Manual</cite></a>,
from the Free Software Foundation.

   <p>If more information is needed, you can go to the Unix manual pages of
the individual MH commands. When the name is not obvious, I'll guide
you to a relevant MH manual page that describes the action more fully.

<!-- ":" does not work in index entries in Info. -->

This manual is available in both Info and online formats. The Info
version is distributed with Emacs and can be accessed with the
<samp><span class="command">info</span></samp> command (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">info mh-e</span></samp>&rsquo;) or within Emacs (<kbd>C-h i
m mh-e &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>). The online version is available at
<a href="http://mh-e.sourceforge.net/manual/">SourceForge</a>. Another great
online resource is the book
<a href="http://rand-mh.sourceforge.net/book/"><cite>MH &amp; nmh: Email for Users &amp; Programmers</cite></a> (also known as <dfn>the MH book</dfn>).

   <p>I hope you enjoy this manual! If you have any comments, or suggestions
for this document, please let me know.
