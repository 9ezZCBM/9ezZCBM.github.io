<p><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007bforw_007d-1084"></a><a name="index-draft-1085"></a><a name="index-forwarding-1086"></a><a name="index-MH-commands_002c-_0040command_007bforw_007d-1087"></a><a name="index-mh_002dforward-1088"></a><a name="index-f-1089"></a><a name="index-mh_002dforward_002dhook-1090"></a>
To forward a message, use the <kbd>f</kbd> (<code>mh-forward</code>) command. You
are prompted for the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">To:</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cc:</span></samp>&rsquo; recipients. You are
given a draft to edit that looks like it would if you had run the MH
command <samp><span class="command">forw</span></samp><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. You can then add some text (see <a href="Editing-Drafts.html#Editing-Drafts">Editing Drafts</a>). 
You can forward several messages by using a range (see <a href="Ranges.html#Ranges">Ranges</a>). 
All of the messages in the range are inserted into your draft. The
hook <code>mh-forward-hook</code> is called on the draft.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007b_002emh_005fprofile_007d-1091"></a><a name="index-files_002c-_0040file_007b_002emh_005fprofile_007d-1092"></a><a name="index-MH-profile-component_002c-_0040samp_007bforw_007d-1093"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bforw_007d-MH-profile-component-1094"></a><a name="index-mh_002dcompose_002dforward_002das_002dmime_002dflag-1095"></a>
By default, the option <code>mh-compose-forward-as-mime-flag</code> is on
which means that the forwarded messages are included as attachments. 
These are inline attachments so the forwarded message should appear in
the body of your recipient's mail program. If you would prefer to
forward your messages verbatim (as text, inline), then turn off this
option. Forwarding messages verbatim works well for short, textual
messages, but your recipient won't be able to view any non-textual
attachments that were in the forwarded message. Be aware that if you
have &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">forw: -mime</span></samp>&rsquo; in your MH profile, then forwarded messages
will always be included as attachments regardless of the settings of
<code>mh-compose-forward-as-mime-flag</code>.

   <p><a name="index-mh_002dforward_002dsubject_002dformat-1096"></a>
The format of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Subject:</span></samp>&rsquo; header field for forwarded messages
is controlled by the option <code>mh-forward-subject-format</code>. This
option is a string which includes two escapes (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>&rsquo;). The first
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>&rsquo; is replaced with the sender of the original message, and the
second one is replaced with the original &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Subject:</span></samp>&rsquo;. The default
value of <code>"%s: %s"</code> takes a message with the header:

<pre class="smallexample">     To: Bill Wohler &lt;wohler@stop.mail-abuse.org&gt;
     Subject: Re: 49er football
     From: Greg DesBrisay &lt;gd@stop.mail-abuse.org&gt;
</pre>
   <p>and creates a subject header field of:

<pre class="smallexample">     Subject: Greg DesBrisay: Re: 49er football
</pre>
