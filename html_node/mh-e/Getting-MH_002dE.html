Because MH-E is undergoing a phase of sustained growth, the version of
MH-E in your Emacs is likely to be out of date although it is most
likely to be more up to date than the copy that comes with the MH
distribution in <samp><span class="file">miscellany/mh-e</span></samp>.

   <p><a name="index-change-log-2231"></a><a name="index-release-notes-2232"></a>
New MH-E releases are always available for downloading at
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mh-e/files/">SourceForge</a>
before they appear in an Emacs release. You can read the release notes
on that page to determine if the given release of MH-E is already
installed in your version of Emacs. You can also read the change log
to see if you are interested in what the given release of MH-E has to
offer (although we have no doubt that you will be extremely interested
in all new releases).

   <p><a name="index-Debian-2233"></a>
If you use Debian, you can install the Debian
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/mail/mh-e">mh-e package</a>
instead.

   <p><a name="index-files_002c-_0040samp_007bMH_002dE_002dNEWS_007d-2234"></a><a name="index-files_002c-_0040samp_007bREADME_007d-2235"></a><a name="index-news-2236"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bMH_002dE_002dNEWS_007d-2237"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bREADME_007d-2238"></a><a name="index-mh_002dversion-2239"></a>
After you download and extract the MH-E tarball, read the
<samp><span class="file">README</span></samp> file and <samp><span class="file">MH-E-NEWS</span></samp>. These correspond to the
release notes and change log mentioned above. The file <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp>
contains instructions on installing MH-E. If you're already running
Emacs, please quit that session and start again to load in the new
MH-E. Check that you're running the new version with the command
<kbd>M-x mh-version</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-contributed-software-2240"></a><a name="index-manual-2241"></a><a name="index-documentation-2242"></a>
In addition to the mh-e package, the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mh-e/files/">SourceForge</a> site
also contains doc and contrib packages. The former is the latest
release of this manual, and the latter contains a few contributed
packages you might find useful.
