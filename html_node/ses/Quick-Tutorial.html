If you want to get started quickly and think that you know what to
expect from a simple spreadsheet, this chapter may be all that you
need.

   <p>First, visit a new file with the <samp><span class="file">.ses</span></samp> extension. 
Emacs presents you with an empty spreadsheet containing a single cell.

   <p>Begin by inserting a headline: <kbd>"Income"&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  The double
quotes indicate that this is a text cell.  (Notice that Emacs
automatically inserts the closing quotation mark.)

   <p>To insert your first income value, you must first resize the
spreadsheet.  Press &lt;TAB&gt; to add a new cell and navigate back up
to it.  Enter a number, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2.23</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Then proceed to add a
few more income entries, e.g.:

<pre class="example">     A
      Income
        2.23
        0.02
       15.76
       -4.00
</pre>
   <p>To add up the values, enter a Lisp expression:

<pre class="example">     (+ A2 A3 A4 A5)
</pre>
   <p>Perhaps you want to add a cell to the right of cell A4 to explain
why you have a negative entry.  Pressing <kbd>TAB</kbd> in that cell
adds an entire new column &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>&rsquo;, where you can add such a note.

   <p>The column is fairly narrow by default, but pressing <kbd>w</kbd> allows
you to resize it as needed.  Make it 20 characters wide.  You can
now add descriptive legends for all the entries, e.g.:

<pre class="example">     A       B
      Income
        2.23       Consulting fee
        0.02     Informed opinion
       15.76       Lemonade stand
          -4          Loan to Joe
       14.01                Total
</pre>
   <p>By default, the labels in column B are right-justified.  To change
that, you can enter a printer function for the whole column, using
e.g., <kbd>M-p ("%s")</kbd>.  You can override a column's printer function
in any individual cell using <kbd>p</kbd>.

   <p>If Joe pays back his loan, you might blank that entry; e.g., by
positioning the cursor in cell A5 and pressing <kbd>C-d</kbd> twice. 
If you do that, the total cell will display &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">######</span></samp>&rsquo;.  That is
because the regular <code>+</code> operator does not handle a range that
contains some empty cells.  Instead of emptying the cell, you could
enter a literal &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>&rsquo;, or delete the entire row using <kbd>C-k</kbd>. 
An alternative is to use the special function <code>ses+</code> instead of
the regular <code>+</code>:

<pre class="example">     (ses+ A2 A3 A4 A5)
</pre>
   <p>To make a formula robust against changes in the spreadsheet geometry,
you can use the <code>ses-range</code> macro to refer to a range of cells by
the end-points, e.g.:

<pre class="example">     (apply 'ses+ (ses-range A2 A5))
</pre>
   <p>(The <code>apply</code> is necessary because <code>ses-range</code> produces a
<em>list</em> of values.  This allows for more complex possibilities.)

   <p>Alternatively you can use the <code>!</code> modifier of <code>ses-range</code> to
remove blank cells from the returned list, which allows to use
<code>+</code> instead of <code>ses+</code>:

<pre class="lisp">     (apply '+ (ses-range A2 A5 !))
</pre>
