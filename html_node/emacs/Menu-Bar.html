<h3 class="section">1.4 The Menu Bar</h3>

<p><a name="index-menu-bar-16"></a>
  Each Emacs frame normally has a <dfn>menu bar</dfn> at the top which you
can use to perform common operations.  There's no need to list them
here, as you can more easily see them yourself.

   <p>On a display that supports a mouse, you can use the mouse to choose a
command from the menu bar.  An arrow on the right edge of a menu item
means it leads to a subsidiary menu, or <dfn>submenu</dfn>.  A &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...</span></samp>&rsquo;
at the end of a menu item means that the command will prompt you for
further input before it actually does anything.

   <p>Some of the commands in the menu bar have ordinary key bindings as
well; if so, a key binding is shown after the item itself.  To view
the full command name and documentation for a menu item, type
<kbd>C-h k</kbd>, and then select the menu bar with the mouse in the usual
way (see <a href="Key-Help.html#Key-Help">Key Help</a>).

   <p><a name="index-F10-17"></a><a name="index-menu_002dbar_002dopen-18"></a><a name="index-menu-bar-access-using-keyboard-19"></a>  Instead of using the mouse, you can also invoke the first menu bar
item by pressing &lt;F10&gt; (to run the command <code>menu-bar-open</code>). 
You can then navigate the menus with the arrow keys or with <kbd>C-b</kbd>,
<kbd>C-f</kbd> (left/right), <kbd>C-p</kbd>, and <kbd>C-n</kbd> (up/down).  To
activate a selected menu item, press &lt;RET&gt;; to cancel menu
navigation, press <kbd>C-g</kbd> or <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd>. 
(However, note that when Emacs was built with a GUI toolkit, the menus
are drawn and controlled by the toolkit, and the key sequences to
cancel menu navigation might be different from the above description.)

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_0060-20"></a><a name="index-tmm_002dmenubar-21"></a><a name="index-tty_002dmenu_002dopen_002duse_002dtmm-22"></a>  On a text terminal, you can optionally access the menu-bar menus in
the echo area.  To this end, customize the variable
<code>tty-menu-open-use-tmm</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value.  Then typing
&lt;F10&gt; will run the command <code>tmm-menubar</code> instead of dropping
down the menu.  (You can also type <kbd>M-`</kbd>, which always invokes
<code>tmm-menubar</code>.)  <code>tmm-menubar</code> lets you select a menu item
with the keyboard.  A provisional choice appears in the echo area. 
You can use the up and down arrow keys to move through the menu to
different items, and then you can type &lt;RET&gt; to select the item. 
Each menu item is also designated by a letter or digit (usually the
initial of some word in the item's name).  This letter or digit is
separated from the item name by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">==&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.  You can type the item's
letter or digit to select the item.
