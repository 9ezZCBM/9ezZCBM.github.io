<p><a name="index-drag-and-drop-1736"></a>
  In most graphical desktop environments, Emacs has basic support for
<dfn>drag and drop</dfn> operations.  For instance, dropping text onto an
Emacs frame inserts the text where it is dropped.  Dropping a file
onto an Emacs frame visits that file.  As a special case, dropping the
file on a Dired buffer moves or copies the file (according to the
conventions of the application it came from) into the directory
displayed in that buffer.

   <p><a name="index-dnd_002dopen_002dfile_002dother_002dwindow-1737"></a>  Dropping a file normally visits it in the window you drop it on.  If
you prefer to visit the file in a new window in such cases, customize
the variable <code>dnd-open-file-other-window</code>.

   <p>The XDND and Motif drag and drop protocols, and the old KDE 1.x
protocol, are currently supported.

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002ddrag_002dand_002ddrop_002dregion-1738"></a>  Emacs can also optionally drag the region with the mouse into
another portion of this or another buffer.  To enable that, customize
the variable <code>mouse-drag-and-drop-region</code> to a non-<code>nil</code>
value.  Normally, the text is moved, i.e. cut and pasted, when the
destination is the same buffer as the origin; dropping the region on
another buffer copies the text instead.  If the value of this variable
names a modifier key, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">shift</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">control</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">alt</span></samp>&rsquo;, then pressing that modifier key when dropping the text
will copy it instead of cutting it, even if you drop on the same
buffer as the one from which the text came.

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002ddrag_002dand_002ddrop_002dregion_002dcut_002dwhen_002dbuffers_002ddiffer-1739"></a><a name="index-mouse_002ddrag_002dand_002ddrop_002dregion_002dshow_002dtooltip-1740"></a><a name="index-mouse_002ddrag_002dand_002ddrop_002dregion_002dshow_002dcursor-1741"></a>In order to cut text even when source and destination buffers differ,
set the option
<code>mouse-drag-and-drop-region-cut-when-buffers-differ</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value.  By default, on a graphic display the selected
text is shown in a tooltip and point moves together with the mouse
cursor during dragging.  To suppress such behavior, set the options
<code>mouse-drag-and-drop-region-show-tooltip</code> and/or
<code>mouse-drag-and-drop-region-show-cursor</code> to <code>nil</code>.
