<h3 class="section">18.10 Diff Mode</h3>

<p><a name="index-Diff-mode-1335"></a><a name="index-diff_002dmode-1336"></a><a name="index-patches_002c-editing-1337"></a>
  Diff mode is a major mode used for the output of <kbd>M-x diff</kbd> and
other similar commands.  This kind of output is called a <dfn>patch</dfn>,
because it can be passed to the <samp><span class="command">patch</span></samp> command to
automatically apply the specified changes.  To select Diff mode
manually, type <kbd>M-x diff-mode</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-hunk_002c-diff-1338"></a>  The changes specified in a patch are grouped into <dfn>hunks</dfn>, which
are contiguous chunks of text that contain one or more changed lines. 
Hunks usually also include unchanged lines to provide context for the
changes.  Each hunk is preceded by a <dfn>hunk header</dfn>, which
specifies the old and new line numbers where the hunk's changes occur. 
Diff mode highlights each hunk header, to distinguish it from the
actual contents of the hunk.

   <p>The first hunk in a patch is preceded by a file header, which shows
the names of the new and the old versions of the file, and their time
stamps.  If a patch shows changes for more than one file, each file
has such a header before the first hunk of that file's changes.

   <p><a name="index-diff_002dupdate_002don_002dthe_002dfly-1339"></a>  You can edit a Diff mode buffer like any other buffer.  (If it is
read-only, you need to make it writable first; see <a href="Misc-Buffer.html#Misc-Buffer">Misc Buffer</a>.) 
Whenever you edit a hunk, Diff mode attempts to automatically correct
the line numbers in the hunk headers, to ensure that the patch remains
correct, and could still be applied by <samp><span class="command">patch</span></samp>.  To disable
automatic line number correction, change the variable
<code>diff-update-on-the-fly</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p>Diff mode arranges for hunks to be treated as compiler error
messages by <kbd>C-x `</kbd> and other commands that handle error messages
(see <a href="Compilation-Mode.html#Compilation-Mode">Compilation Mode</a>).  Thus, you can use the compilation-mode
commands to visit the corresponding source locations.

   <p>In addition, Diff mode provides the following commands to navigate,
manipulate and apply parts of patches:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-n</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dhunk_002dnext-1340"></a>Move to the next hunk-start (<code>diff-hunk-next</code>).  With prefix
argument <var>n</var>, move forward to the <var>n</var>th next hunk.

     <p><a name="index-diff_002dauto_002drefine_002dmode-1341"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Diff-Auto_002dRefine-1342"></a><a name="index-Diff-Auto_002dRefine-mode-1343"></a>This command has a side effect: it <dfn>refines</dfn> the hunk you move to,
highlighting its changes with better granularity.  To disable this
feature, type <kbd>M-x diff-auto-refine-mode</kbd> to toggle off the minor
mode Diff Auto-Refine mode.  To disable Diff Auto-Refine mode by
default, add this to your init file (see <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>):

     <pre class="example">          (add-hook 'diff-mode-hook
                    (lambda () (diff-auto-refine-mode -1)))
</pre>
     <br><dt><kbd>M-p</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dhunk_002dprev-1344"></a>Move to the previous hunk-start (<code>diff-hunk-prev</code>).  With prefix
argument <var>n</var>, move back to the <var>n</var>th previous hunk.  Like
<kbd>M-n</kbd>, this has the side-effect of refining the hunk you move to,
unless you disable Diff Auto-Refine mode.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-}</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dfile_002dnext-1345"></a>Move to the next file-start, in a multi-file patch
(<code>diff-file-next</code>).  With prefix argument <var>n</var>, move forward
to the start of the <var>n</var>th next file.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-{</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dfile_002dprev-1346"></a>Move to the previous file-start, in a multi-file patch
(<code>diff-file-prev</code>).  With prefix argument <var>n</var>, move back to
the start of the <var>n</var>th previous file.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-k</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dhunk_002dkill-1347"></a>Kill the hunk at point (<code>diff-hunk-kill</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>M-K</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dfile_002dkill-1348"></a>In a multi-file patch, kill the current file part. 
(<code>diff-file-kill</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-a</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dapply_002dhunk-1349"></a><a name="index-patches_002c-applying-1350"></a>Apply this hunk to its target file (<code>diff-apply-hunk</code>).  With a
prefix argument of <kbd>C-u</kbd>, revert this hunk, i.e. apply the
reverse of the hunk, which changes the &ldquo;new&rdquo; version into the &ldquo;old&rdquo;
version.  If <code>diff-jump-to-old-file</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, apply the
hunk to the &ldquo;old&rdquo; version of the file instead.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-b</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002drefine_002dhunk-1351"></a>Highlight the changes of the hunk at point with a finer granularity
(<code>diff-refine-hunk</code>).  This allows you to see exactly which parts
of each changed line were actually changed.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-c</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dgoto_002dsource-1352"></a><a name="index-diff_002djump_002dto_002dold_002dfile-1353"></a>Go to the source file and line corresponding to this hunk
(<code>diff-goto-source</code>).  By default, this jumps to the &ldquo;new&rdquo;
version of the file, the one shown first on the file header. 
With a prefix argument, jump to the &ldquo;old&rdquo; version instead.  If
<code>diff-jump-to-old-file</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, this command by
default jumps to the &ldquo;old&rdquo; file, and the meaning of the prefix
argument is reversed.  If the prefix argument is a number greater than
8 (e.g., if you type <kbd>C-u C-u C-c C-c</kbd>), then this command also
sets <code>diff-jump-to-old-file</code> for the next invocation.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-e</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dediff_002dpatch-1354"></a>Start an Ediff session with the patch (<code>diff-ediff-patch</code>). 
See <a href="../ediff/index.html#Top">Ediff</a>.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-n</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002drestrict_002dview-1355"></a>Restrict the view to the current hunk (<code>diff-restrict-view</code>). 
See <a href="Narrowing.html#Narrowing">Narrowing</a>.  With a prefix argument, restrict the
view to the current file of a multiple-file patch.  To widen again,
use <kbd>C-x n w</kbd> (<code>widen</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-r</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dreverse_002ddirection-1356"></a>Reverse the direction of comparison for the entire buffer
(<code>diff-reverse-direction</code>).  With a prefix argument, reverse the
direction only inside the current region (see <a href="Mark.html#Mark">Mark</a>).  Reversing
the direction means changing the hunks and the file-start headers to
produce a patch that would change the &ldquo;new&rdquo; version into the &ldquo;old&rdquo;
one.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-s</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dsplit_002dhunk-1357"></a>Split the hunk at point (<code>diff-split-hunk</code>) into two separate
hunks.  This inserts a hunk header and modifies the header of the
current hunk.  This command is useful for manually editing patches,
and only works with the <dfn>unified diff format</dfn> produced by the
<samp><span class="option">-u</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">--unified</span></samp> options to the <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp>
program.  If you need to split a hunk in the <dfn>context diff format</dfn>
produced by the <samp><span class="option">-c</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">--context</span></samp> options to
<samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp>, first convert the buffer to the unified diff format
with <kbd>C-c C-u</kbd>.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-d</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dunified_002d_003econtext-1358"></a>Convert the entire buffer to the <dfn>context diff format</dfn>
(<code>diff-unified-&gt;context</code>).  With a prefix argument, convert only
the hunks within the region.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-u</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dcontext_002d_003eunified-1359"></a>Convert the entire buffer to unified diff format
(<code>diff-context-&gt;unified</code>).  With a prefix argument, convert
unified format to context format.  When the mark is active, convert
only the hunks within the region.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-w</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dignore_002dwhitespace_002dhunk-1360"></a>Re-generate the current hunk, disregarding changes in whitespace
(<code>diff-ignore-whitespace-hunk</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x 4 A</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dadd_002dchange_002dlog_002dentries_002dother_002dwindow-1361"></a><a name="index-add_002dchange_002dlog_002dentry_002dother_002dwindow_0040r_007b_002c-in-Diff-mode_007d-1362"></a>Generate a ChangeLog entry, like <kbd>C-x 4 a</kbd> does (see <a href="Change-Log.html#Change-Log">Change Log</a>), for each one of the hunks
(<code>diff-add-change-log-entries-other-window</code>).  This creates a
skeleton of the log of changes that you can later fill with the actual
descriptions of the changes.  <kbd>C-x 4 a</kbd> itself in Diff mode
operates on behalf of the current hunk's file, but gets the function
name from the patch itself.  This is useful for making log entries for
functions that are deleted by the patch. 
</dl>

<!-- Trailing whitespace is NOT shown by default. -->
<!-- Emacs's dir-locals file enables this (for some reason). -->
   <p><a name="index-trailing-whitespace_002c-in-patches-1363"></a><a name="index-diff_002ddelete_002dtrailing_002dwhitespace-1364"></a>  Patches sometimes include trailing whitespace on modified lines, as
an unintentional and undesired change.  There are two ways to deal
with this problem.  Firstly, if you enable Whitespace mode in a Diff
buffer (see <a href="Useless-Whitespace.html#Useless-Whitespace">Useless Whitespace</a>), it automatically highlights
trailing whitespace in modified lines.  Secondly, you can use the
command <kbd>M-x diff-delete-trailing-whitespace</kbd>, which searches for
trailing whitespace in the lines modified by the patch, and removes
that whitespace in both the patch and the patched source file(s). 
This command does not save the modifications that it makes, so you can
decide whether to save the changes (the list of modified files is
displayed in the echo area).  With a prefix argument, it tries to
modify the original (&ldquo;old&rdquo;) source files rather than the patched
(&ldquo;new&rdquo;) source files.
