<p><a name="index-mode-line_002c-mouse-1670"></a><a name="index-mouse-on-mode-line-1671"></a>
  You can use mouse clicks on window mode lines to select and manipulate
windows.

   <p>Some areas of the mode line, such as the buffer name, and major and minor
mode names, have their own special mouse bindings.  These areas are
highlighted when you hold the mouse over them, and information about
the special bindings will be displayed (see <a href="Tooltips.html#Tooltips">Tooltips</a>).  This
section's commands do not apply in those areas.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>mouse-1</kbd><dd><a name="index-mouse_002d1-_0040r_007b_0028mode-line_0029_007d-1672"></a><kbd>mouse-1</kbd> on a mode line selects the window it belongs to.  By
dragging <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> on the mode line, you can move it, thus
changing the height of the windows above and below.  Changing heights
with the mouse in this way never deletes windows, it just refuses to
make any window smaller than the minimum height.

     <br><dt><kbd>mouse-2</kbd><dd><a name="index-mouse_002d2-_0040r_007b_0028mode-line_0029_007d-1673"></a><kbd>mouse-2</kbd> on a mode line expands that window to fill its frame.

     <br><dt><kbd>mouse-3</kbd><dd><a name="index-mouse_002d3-_0040r_007b_0028mode-line_0029_007d-1674"></a><kbd>mouse-3</kbd> on a mode line deletes the window it belongs to.  If the
frame has only one window, it does nothing.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-mouse-2</kbd><dd><kbd>C-mouse-2</kbd> on a mode line splits that window, producing two
side-by-side windows with the boundary running through the click
position (see <a href="Split-Window.html#Split-Window">Split Window</a>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002d1-_0040r_007b_0028scroll-bar_0029_007d-1675"></a>  Furthermore, by clicking and dragging <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> on the divider
between two side-by-side mode lines, you can move the vertical
boundary to the left or right.

   <p>Note that resizing windows is affected by the value of
<code>window-resize-pixelwise</code>, see <a href="Split-Window.html#Split-Window">Split Window</a>.
