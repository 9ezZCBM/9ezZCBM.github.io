<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.11.2 Pulling/Pushing Changes into/from a Branch</h5>

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x v P</kbd><dd>On a decentralized version control system, update another location
with changes from the current branch (a.k.a. &ldquo;push&rdquo; changes).  This
concept does not exist for centralized version control systems

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x v +</kbd><dd>On a decentralized version control system, update the current branch
by &ldquo;pulling in&rdquo; changes from another location.

     <p>On a centralized version control system, update the current VC
fileset. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-v-P-3138"></a><a name="index-vc_002dpush-3139"></a>On a decentralized version control system, the command <kbd>C-x v P</kbd>
(<code>vc-push</code>) updates another location with changes from the
current branch.  With a prefix argument, it prompts for the exact
version control command to run, which lets you specify where to push
changes; the default is <samp><span class="command">bzr push</span></samp> with Bazaar, <samp><span class="command">git
push</span></samp> with Git, and <samp><span class="command">hg push</span></samp> with Mercurial.  The default
commands always push to a default location determined by the version
control system from your branch configuration.

   <p>Prior to pushing, you can use <kbd>C-x v O</kbd> (<code>vc-log-outgoing</code>)
to view a log buffer of the changes to be sent.  See <a href="VC-Change-Log.html#VC-Change-Log">VC Change Log</a>.

   <p><a name="index-bound-branch-_0028Bazaar-VCS_0029-3140"></a>This command is currently supported only by Bazaar, Git, and Mercurial. 
The concept of &ldquo;pushing&rdquo; does not exist for centralized version
control systems, where this operation is a part of committing a
changeset, so invoking this command on a centralized VCS signals an
error.  This command also signals an error when attempted in a Bazaar
<dfn>bound branch</dfn>, where committing a changeset automatically pushes
the changes to the remote repository to which the local branch is
bound.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-v-_002b-3141"></a><a name="index-vc_002dpull-3142"></a>  On a decentralized version control system, the command <kbd>C-x v +</kbd>
(<code>vc-pull</code>) updates the current branch and working tree.  It is
typically used to update a copy of a remote branch.  If you supply a
prefix argument, the command prompts for the exact version control
command to use, which lets you specify where to pull changes from. 
Otherwise, it pulls from a default location determined by the version
control system.

   <p>Amongst decentralized version control systems, <kbd>C-x v +</kbd> is
currently supported only by Bazaar, Git, and Mercurial.  With Bazaar,
it calls <samp><span class="command">bzr pull</span></samp> for ordinary branches (to pull from a
master branch into a mirroring branch), and <samp><span class="command">bzr update</span></samp> for a
bound branch (to pull from a central repository).  With Git, it calls
<samp><span class="command">git pull</span></samp> to fetch changes from a remote repository and merge
it into the current branch.  With Mercurial, it calls <samp><span class="command">hg pull
-u</span></samp> to fetch changesets from the default remote repository and update
the working directory.

   <p>Prior to pulling, you can use <kbd>C-x v I</kbd> (<code>vc-log-incoming</code>)
to view a log buffer of the changes to be applied.  See <a href="VC-Change-Log.html#VC-Change-Log">VC Change Log</a>.

   <p>On a centralized version control system like CVS, <kbd>C-x v +</kbd>
updates the current VC fileset from the repository.
