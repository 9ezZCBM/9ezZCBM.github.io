<h4 class="subsection">31.10.1 The Diary File</h4>

<p><a name="index-diary-file-3716"></a>
<a name="index-diary_002dfile-3717"></a>  Your <dfn>diary file</dfn> is a file that records events associated with
particular dates.  The name of the diary file is specified by the
variable <code>diary-file</code>.  The default is <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/diary</span></samp>,
though for compatibility with older versions Emacs will use
<samp><span class="file">~/diary</span></samp> if it exists.

   <p>Each entry in the diary file describes one event and consists of one
or more lines.  An entry always begins with a date specification at the
left margin.  The rest of the entry is simply text to describe the
event.  If the entry has more than one line, then the lines after the
first must begin with whitespace to indicate they continue a previous
entry.  Lines that do not begin with valid dates and do not continue a
preceding entry are ignored.  Here's an example:

<pre class="example">     12/22/2015  Twentieth wedding anniversary!
     10/22       Ruth's birthday.
     * 21, *:    Payday
     Tuesday--weekly meeting with grad students at 10am
              Supowit, Shen, Bitner, and Kapoor to attend.
     1/13/89     Friday the thirteenth!!
     thu 4pm     squash game with Lloyd.
     mar 16      Dad's birthday
     April 15, 2016 Income tax due.
     * 15        time cards due.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This example uses extra spaces to align the event descriptions of most
of the entries.  Such formatting is purely a matter of taste.

   <p>You can also use a format where the first line of a diary entry
consists only of the date or day name (with no following blanks or
punctuation).  For example:

<pre class="example">     02/11/2012
           Bill B. visits Princeton today
           2pm Cognitive Studies Committee meeting
           2:30-5:30 Liz at Lawrenceville
           4:00pm Dentist appt
           7:30pm Dinner at George's
           8:00-10:00pm concert
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This entry will have a different appearance if you use the simple diary
display
(see <a href="Diary-Display.html#Diary-Display">Diary Display</a>). 
The simple diary display omits the date line at the beginning; only the
continuation lines appear.  This style of entry looks neater when you
display just a single day's entries, but can cause confusion if you ask
for more than one day's entries.
