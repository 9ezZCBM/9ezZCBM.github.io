<p><a name="index-search-customizations-1076"></a>
  This section describes miscellaneous search-related customizations
not described elsewhere.

   <p><a name="index-default-search-mode-1077"></a><a name="index-search-mode_002c-default-1078"></a>  The default search mode for the incremental search is specified by
the variable <code>search-default-mode</code>.  It can be <code>nil</code>,
<code>t</code>, or a function.  If it is <code>nil</code>, the default mode is to
do literal searches without character folding, but with case folding
and lax-whitespace matches as determined by <code>case-fold-search</code>
and <code>search-whitespace-regexp</code>, respectively (see <a href="Lax-Search.html#Lax-Search">Lax Search</a>).  If the value is <code>t</code>, incremental search defaults to
regexp searches.  The default value specifies a function that only
performs case folding and lax-whitespace matching.

   <p><a name="index-search_002dhighlight-1079"></a>  The current match of an on-going incremental search is highlighted
using the <code>isearch</code> face.  This highlighting can be disabled by
setting the variable <code>search-highlight</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-lazy-highlighting-customizations-1080"></a><a name="index-isearch_002dlazy_002dhighlight-1081"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007blazy_002dhighlight_007d-face-1082"></a>  The other matches for the search string that are visible on display
are highlighted using the <code>lazy-highlight</code> face.  Setting the
variable <code>isearch-lazy-highlight</code> to <code>nil</code> disables this
highlighting.  Here are some other variables that customize the lazy
highlighting:

     <dl>
<dt><code>lazy-highlight-initial-delay</code><dd>Time in seconds to wait before highlighting visible matches.

     <br><dt><code>lazy-highlight-interval</code><dd>Time in seconds between highlighting successive matches.

     <br><dt><code>lazy-highlight-max-at-a-time</code><dd>The maximum number of matches to highlight before checking for input. 
A large number can take some time to highlight, so if you want to
continue searching and type <kbd>C-s</kbd> or <kbd>C-r</kbd> during that time,
Emacs will not respond until it finishes highlighting all those
matches.  Thus, smaller values make Emacs more responsive. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-search_002dnonincremental_002dinstead-1083"></a>  Normally, entering &lt;RET&gt; within incremental search when the
search string is empty launches a nonincremental search.  (Actually,
it lets you edit the search string, and the next &lt;RET&gt; does the
search.)  However, if you customize the variable
<code>search-nonincremental-instead</code> to <code>nil</code>, typing &lt;RET&gt;
will always exit the incremental search, even if the search string is
empty.

   <p><a name="index-isearch_002dhide_002dimmediately-1084"></a>  By default, incremental search and query-replace commands match
invisible text, but hide any such matches as soon as the current match
moves off the invisible text.  If you customize the variable
<code>isearch-hide-immediately</code> to <code>nil</code>, any invisible text
where matches were found stays on display until the search or the
replace command exits.

   <p><a name="index-search-display-on-slow-terminals-1085"></a><a name="index-search_002dslow_002dspeed-1086"></a><a name="index-search_002dslow_002dwindow_002dlines-1087"></a>  Searching incrementally on slow terminals, such as displays
connected to remote machines over slow connection, could be annoying
due to the need to redraw large portions of the display as the search
proceeds.  Emacs provides a special display mode for slow terminals,
whereby search pops up a separate small window and displays the text
surrounding the match in that window.  Small windows display faster,
so the annoying effect of slow speed is alleviated.  The variable
<code>search-slow-speed</code> determines the baud rate threshold below
which Emacs will use this display mode.  The variable
<code>search-slow-window-lines</code> controls the number of lines in the
window Emacs pops up for displaying the search results; the default is
1 line.  Normally, this window will pop up at the bottom of the window
that displays the buffer where you start searching, but if the value
of <code>search-slow-window-lines</code> is negative, that means to put the
window at the top and give it the number of lines that is the absolute
value of <code>search-slow-window-lines</code>.
