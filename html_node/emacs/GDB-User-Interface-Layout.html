<h5 class="subsubsection">27.6.5.1 GDB User Interface Layout</h5>

<p><a name="index-GDB-User-Interface-layout-2945"></a>
<a name="index-gdb_002dmany_002dwindows-2946"></a><a name="index-gdb_002dshow_002dmain-2947"></a>  If the variable <code>gdb-many-windows</code> is <code>nil</code> (the default),
<kbd>M-x gdb</kbd> normally displays only the GUD interaction buffer. 
However, if the variable <code>gdb-show-main</code> is also non-<code>nil</code>,
it starts with two windows: one displaying the GUD interaction buffer,
and the other showing the source for the <code>main</code> function of the
program you are debugging.

   <p>If <code>gdb-many-windows</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, then <kbd>M-x gdb</kbd>
displays the following frame layout:

<pre class="smallexample">     +--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
     |   GUD interaction buffer       |   Locals/Registers buffer      |
     |--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
     |   Primary Source buffer        |   I/O buffer for debugged pgm  |
     |--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
     |   Stack buffer                 |   Breakpoints/Threads buffer   |
     +--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-gdb_002drestore_002dwindows-2948"></a><a name="index-gdb_002dmany_002dwindows-2949"></a>  If you ever change the window layout, you can restore the many-windows
layout by typing <kbd>M-x gdb-restore-windows</kbd>.  To toggle
between the many windows layout and a simple layout with just the GUD
interaction buffer and a source file, type <kbd>M-x gdb-many-windows</kbd>.

   <p>If you have an elaborate window setup, and don't want
<code>gdb-many-windows</code> to disrupt that, it is better to invoke
<kbd>M-x gdb</kbd> in a separate frame to begin with, then the arrangement
of windows on your original frame will not be affected.  A separate
frame for GDB sessions can come in especially handy if you work on a
text-mode terminal, where the screen estate for windows could be at a
premium.

   <p>You may also specify additional GDB-related buffers to display,
either in the same frame or a different one.  Select the buffers you
want by typing <kbd>M-x gdb-display-</kbd><var>buffertype</var><kbd>-buffer</kbd> or
<kbd>M-x gdb-frame-</kbd><var>buffertype</var><kbd>-buffer</kbd>, where <var>buffertype</var>
is the relevant buffer type, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">breakpoints</span></samp>&rsquo;.  You can do
the same with the menu bar, with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">GDB-Windows</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">GDB-Frames</span></samp>&rsquo; sub-menus of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">GUD</span></samp>&rsquo; menu.

   <p>When you finish debugging, kill the GUD interaction buffer with
<kbd>C-x k</kbd>, which will also kill all the buffers associated with the
session.  However you need not do this if, after editing and
re-compiling your source code within Emacs, you wish to continue
debugging.  When you restart execution, GDB automatically finds the
new executable.  Keeping the GUD interaction buffer has the advantage
of keeping the shell history as well as GDB's breakpoints.  You do
need to check that the breakpoints in recently edited source files are
still in the right places.
