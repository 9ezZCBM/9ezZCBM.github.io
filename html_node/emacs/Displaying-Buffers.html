<h3 class="section">20.6 Displaying a Buffer in a Window</h3>

<p>It is a common Emacs operation to display or pop up some buffer
in response to a user command.  There are several different ways in
which commands do this.

   <p>Many commands, like <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> (<code>find-file</code>), by default
display the buffer by &ldquo;taking over&rdquo; the selected window, expecting
that the user's attention will be diverted to that buffer.

   <p>Some commands try to display intelligently, trying not to take
over the selected window, e.g., by splitting off a new window and
displaying the desired buffer there.  Such commands, which include the
various help commands (see <a href="Help.html#Help">Help</a>), work by calling
<code>display-buffer</code> internally.  See <a href="Window-Choice.html#Window-Choice">Window Choice</a>, for details.

   <p>Other commands do the same as <code>display-buffer</code>, and
additionally select the displaying window so that you can begin
editing its buffer.  The command <kbd>C-x `</kbd> (<code>next-error</code>) is
one example (see <a href="Compilation-Mode.html#Compilation-Mode">Compilation Mode</a>).  Such commands work by calling
the function <code>pop-to-buffer</code> internally.  See <a href="../elisp/Switching-Buffers.html#Switching-Buffers">Switching to a Buffer in a Window</a>.

   <p>Commands with names ending in <code>-other-window</code> behave like
<code>display-buffer</code>, except that they never display in the selected
window.  Several of these commands are bound in the <kbd>C-x 4</kbd> prefix
key (see <a href="Pop-Up-Window.html#Pop-Up-Window">Pop Up Window</a>).

   <p>Commands with names ending in <code>-other-frame</code> behave like
<code>display-buffer</code>, except that they (i) never display in the
selected window and (ii) prefer to either create a new frame or use a
window on some other frame to display the desired buffer.  Several of
these commands are bound in the <kbd>C-x 5</kbd> prefix key.
