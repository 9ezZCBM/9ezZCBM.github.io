<h3 class="section">18.1 File Names</h3>

<p><a name="index-file-names-1185"></a>
<a name="index-default-file-name-1186"></a>  Many Emacs commands that operate on a file require you to specify
the file name, using the minibuffer (see <a href="Minibuffer-File.html#Minibuffer-File">Minibuffer File</a>).

   <p>While in the minibuffer, you can use the usual completion and
history commands (see <a href="Minibuffer.html#Minibuffer">Minibuffer</a>).  Note that file name completion
ignores file names whose extensions appear in the variable
<code>completion-ignored-extensions</code> (see <a href="Completion-Options.html#Completion-Options">Completion Options</a>). 
Note also that most commands use permissive completion with
confirmation for reading file names: you are allowed to submit a
nonexistent file name, but if you type &lt;RET&gt; immediately after
completing up to a nonexistent file name, Emacs prints
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Confirm]</span></samp>&rsquo; and you must type a second &lt;RET&gt; to confirm. 
See <a href="Completion-Exit.html#Completion-Exit">Completion Exit</a>, for details.

   <p>Minibuffer history commands offer some special features for reading
file names, see <a href="Minibuffer-History.html#Minibuffer-History">Minibuffer History</a>.

   <p><a name="index-default-directory_002c-of-a-buffer-1187"></a><a name="index-default_002ddirectory-1188"></a>  Each buffer has a <dfn>default directory</dfn>, stored in the
buffer-local variable <code>default-directory</code>.  Whenever Emacs reads
a file name using the minibuffer, it usually inserts the default
directory into the minibuffer as the initial contents.  You can
inhibit this insertion by changing the variable
<code>insert-default-directory</code> to <code>nil</code> (see <a href="Minibuffer-File.html#Minibuffer-File">Minibuffer File</a>).  Regardless, Emacs always assumes that any relative file name
is relative to the default directory, e.g., entering a file name
without a directory specifies a file in the default directory.

   <p><a name="index-cd-1189"></a><a name="index-pwd-1190"></a>  When you visit a file, Emacs sets <code>default-directory</code> in the
visiting buffer to the directory of its file.  When you create a new
buffer that is not visiting a file, via a command like <kbd>C-x b</kbd>,
its default directory is usually copied from the buffer that was
current at the time (see <a href="Select-Buffer.html#Select-Buffer">Select Buffer</a>).  You can use the command
<kbd>M-x pwd</kbd> to see the value of <code>default-directory</code> in the
current buffer.  The command <kbd>M-x cd</kbd> prompts for a directory's
name, and sets the buffer's <code>default-directory</code> to that directory
(doing this does not change the buffer's file name, if any).

   <p>As an example, when you visit the file <samp><span class="file">/u/rms/gnu/gnu.tasks</span></samp>,
the default directory is set to <samp><span class="file">/u/rms/gnu/</span></samp>.  If you invoke a
command that reads a file name, entering just &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo; in the
minibuffer, with a directory omitted, specifies the file
<samp><span class="file">/u/rms/gnu/foo</span></samp>; entering &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">../.login</span></samp>&rsquo; specifies
<samp><span class="file">/u/rms/.login</span></samp>; and entering &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">new/foo</span></samp>&rsquo; specifies
<samp><span class="file">/u/rms/gnu/new/foo</span></samp>.

   <p>When typing a file name into the minibuffer, you can make use of a
couple of shortcuts: a double slash ignores everything before the
second slash in the pair, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~/</span></samp>&rsquo; is your home directory. 
See <a href="Minibuffer-File.html#Minibuffer-File">Minibuffer File</a>.

   <p><a name="index-environment-variables-in-file-names-1191"></a><a name="index-expansion-of-environment-variables-1192"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_0024_007d-in-file-names-1193"></a>  <a name="File-Names-with-_0024"></a>The character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; is used to
substitute an environment variable into a file name.  The name of the
environment variable consists of all the alphanumeric characters after
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;; alternatively, it can be enclosed in braces after the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;.  For example, if you have used the shell command
<samp><span class="command">export FOO=rms/hacks</span></samp> to set up an environment variable named
<samp><span class="env">FOO</span></samp>, then both <samp><span class="file">/u/$FOO/test.c</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">/u/${FOO}/test.c</span></samp> are abbreviations for
<samp><span class="file">/u/rms/hacks/test.c</span></samp>.  If the environment variable is not
defined, no substitution occurs, so that the character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; stands
for itself.  Note that environment variables set outside Emacs affect
Emacs only if they are applied before Emacs is started.

   <p>To access a file with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; in its name, if the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; causes
expansion, type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$$</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This pair is converted to a single
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; at the same time that variable substitution is performed for
a single &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Alternatively, quote the whole file name with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/:</span></samp>&rsquo; (see <a href="Quoted-File-Names.html#Quoted-File-Names">Quoted File Names</a>).  File names which begin with a
literal &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>&rsquo; should also be quoted with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/:</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>You can include non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters in file names.
