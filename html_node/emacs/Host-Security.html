Emacs runs inside an operating system such as GNU/Linux, and relies on
the operating system to check security constraints such as accesses to
files.  The default settings for Emacs are designed for typical use;
they may require some tailoring in environments where security is more
of a concern, or less of a concern, than usual.  For example,
file-local variables can be risky, and you can set the variable
<code>enable-local-variables</code> to <code>:safe</code> or (even more
conservatively) to <code>nil</code>; conversely, if your files can all be
trusted and the default checking for these variables is irritating,
you can set <code>enable-local-variables</code> to <code>:all</code>.  See <a href="Safe-File-Variables.html#Safe-File-Variables">Safe File Variables</a>.

   <p>See <a href="../elisp/Security-Considerations.html#Security-Considerations">Security Considerations</a>, for more information about security considerations when using
Emacs as part of a larger application.
