<h3 class="section">21.2 Mouse Commands for Words and Lines</h3>

<p>These variants of <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> select entire words or lines at a
time.  Emacs activates the region around the selected text, which is
also copied to the kill ring.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>Double-mouse-1</kbd><dd>Select the text around the word or character which you click on.

     <p>Double-clicking on a character with symbol syntax (such as
underscore, in C mode) selects the symbol surrounding that character. 
Double-clicking on a character with open- or close-parenthesis syntax
selects the parenthetical grouping which that character starts or
ends.  Double-clicking on a character with string-delimiter syntax
(such as a single-quote or double-quote in C) selects the string
constant (Emacs uses heuristics to figure out whether that character
is the beginning or the end of it).

     <p>Double-clicking on the beginning of a parenthetical grouping or
beginning string-delimiter moves point to the end of the region,
scrolling the buffer display forward if necessary to show the new
location of point.  Double-clicking on the end of a parenthetical
grouping or end string-delimiter keeps point at the end of the region
by default, so the beginning of the region will not be visible if it
is above the top of the window; setting the user option
<code>mouse-select-region-move-to-beginning</code> to non-<code>nil</code> changes
this to move point to the beginning of the region, scrolling the
display backward if necessary.

     <br><dt><kbd>Double-Drag-mouse-1</kbd><dd>Select the text you drag across, in units of whole words.

     <br><dt><kbd>Triple-mouse-1</kbd><dd>Select the line you click on.

     <br><dt><kbd>Triple-Drag-mouse-1</kbd><dd>Select the text you drag across, in units of whole lines.
