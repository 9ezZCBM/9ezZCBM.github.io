<h3 class="section">51.1 If &lt;DEL&gt; Fails to Delete</h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040key_007bDEL_007d-vs-_0040key_007bBACKSPACE_007d-4886"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040key_007bBACKSPACE_007d-vs-_0040key_007bDEL_007d-4887"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040key_007bDEL_007d-does-not-delete-4888"></a>
  Every keyboard has a large key, usually labeled &lt;BACKSPACE&gt;,
which is ordinarily used to erase the last character that you typed. 
In Emacs, this key is supposed to be equivalent to &lt;DEL&gt;.

   <p>When Emacs starts up on a graphical display, it determines
automatically which key should be &lt;DEL&gt;.  In some unusual cases,
Emacs gets the wrong information from the system, and &lt;BACKSPACE&gt;
ends up deleting forwards instead of backwards.

   <p>Some keyboards also have a &lt;Delete&gt; key, which is ordinarily
used to delete forwards.  If this key deletes backward in Emacs, that
too suggests Emacs got the wrong information&mdash;but in the opposite
sense.

   <p>On a text terminal, if you find that &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; prompts for a
Help command, like <kbd>Control-h</kbd>, instead of deleting a character,
it means that key is actually sending the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">BS</span></samp>&rsquo; character.  Emacs
ought to be treating &lt;BS&gt; as &lt;DEL&gt;, but it isn't.

   <p><a name="index-normal_002derase_002dis_002dbackspace_002dmode-4889"></a>  In all of those cases, the immediate remedy is the same: use the
command <kbd>M-x normal-erase-is-backspace-mode</kbd>.  This toggles
between the two modes that Emacs supports for handling &lt;DEL&gt;, so
if Emacs starts in the wrong mode, this should switch to the right
mode.  On a text terminal, if you want to ask for help when &lt;BS&gt;
is treated as &lt;DEL&gt;, use &lt;F1&gt; instead of <kbd>C-h</kbd>; <kbd>C-?</kbd>
may also work, if it sends character code 127.

   <p>To fix the problem in every Emacs session, put one of the following
lines into your initialization file (see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>).  For the
first case above, where &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; deletes forwards instead of
backwards, use this line to make &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; act as &lt;DEL&gt;:

<pre class="lisp">     (normal-erase-is-backspace-mode 0)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For the other two cases, use this line:

<pre class="lisp">     (normal-erase-is-backspace-mode 1)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-normal_002derase_002dis_002dbackspace-4890"></a>  Another way to fix the problem for every Emacs session is to
customize the variable <code>normal-erase-is-backspace</code>: the value
<code>t</code> specifies the mode where &lt;BS&gt; or &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; is
&lt;DEL&gt;, and <code>nil</code> specifies the other mode.  See <a href="Easy-Customization.html#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>.
