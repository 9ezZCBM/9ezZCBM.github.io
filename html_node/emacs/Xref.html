<h3 class="section">28.3 Find Identifier References</h3>

<p><a name="index-xref-3186"></a>
  An <dfn>identifier</dfn> is a name of a syntactical subunit of the
program: a function, a subroutine, a method, a class, a data type, a
macro, etc.  In a programming language, each identifier is a symbol in
the language's syntax.  Program development and maintenance requires
capabilities to quickly find where each identifier was defined and
referenced, to rename identifiers across the entire project, etc.

   <p>These capabilities are also useful for finding references in major
modes other than those defined to support programming languages.  For
example, chapters, sections, appendices, etc. of a text or a TeX
document can be treated as subunits as well, and their names can be
used as identifiers.  In this chapter, we use the term &ldquo;identifiers&rdquo;
to collectively refer to the names of any kind of subunits, in program
source and in other kinds of text alike.

   <p>Emacs provides a unified interface to these capabilities, called
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xref</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p><a name="index-xref-backend-3187"></a>To do its job, <code>xref</code> needs to make use of information and to
employ methods specific to the major mode.  What files to search for
identifiers, how to find references to identifiers, how to complete on
identifiers&mdash;all this and more is mode-specific knowledge. 
<code>xref</code> delegates the mode-specific parts of its job to a
<dfn>backend</dfn> provided by the mode; it also includes defaults for some
of its commands, for those modes that don't provide their own.

   <p>A backend can implement its capabilities in a variety of ways.  Here
are a few examples:

     <ol type=a start=1>
<li>Some major modes provide built-in means for looking up the language
symbols.  For example, Emacs Lisp symbols can be identified by
searching the package load history, maintained by the Emacs Lisp
interpreter, and by consulting the built-in documentation strings; the
Emacs Lisp mode uses these facilities in its backend to allow finding
definitions of symbols.  (One disadvantage of this kind of backend is
that it only knows about subunits that were loaded into the
interpreter.)

     <li>An external program can extract references by scanning the relevant
files, and build a database of these references.  A backend can then
access this database whenever it needs to list or look up references. 
The Emacs distribution includes <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp>, a command for tagging
identifier definitions in programs, which supports many programming
languages and other major modes, such as HTML, by extracting
references into <dfn>tags tables</dfn>.  See <a href="Create-Tags-Table.html#Create-Tags-Table">Create Tags Table</a>.  Major
modes for languages supported by <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> can use tags tables
as basis for their backend.  (One disadvantage of this kind of backend
is that tags tables need to be kept reasonably up to date, by
rebuilding them from time to time.)
