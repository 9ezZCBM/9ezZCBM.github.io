<h3 class="section">18.12 Miscellaneous File Operations</h3>

<p>Emacs has commands for performing many other operations on files. 
All operate on one file; they do not accept wildcard file names.

   <p><a name="index-delete_002dfile-1374"></a><a name="index-deletion-_0028of-files_0029-1375"></a>  <kbd>M-x delete-file</kbd> prompts for a file and deletes it.  If you are
deleting many files in one directory, it may be more convenient to use
Dired rather than <code>delete-file</code>.  See <a href="Dired-Deletion.html#Dired-Deletion">Dired Deletion</a>.

   <p><a name="index-trash-1376"></a><a name="index-recycle-bin-1377"></a><a name="index-move_002dfile_002dto_002dtrash-1378"></a>  <kbd>M-x move-file-to-trash</kbd> moves a file into the system
<dfn>Trash</dfn> (or <dfn>Recycle Bin</dfn>).  This is a facility available on
most operating systems; files that are moved into the Trash can be
brought back later if you change your mind.  (The way to restore
trashed files is system-dependent.)

   <p><a name="index-delete_002dby_002dmoving_002dto_002dtrash-1379"></a>  By default, Emacs deletion commands do <em>not</em> use the Trash.  To
use the Trash (when it is available) for common deletion commands,
change the variable <code>delete-by-moving-to-trash</code> to <code>t</code>. 
This affects the commands <kbd>M-x delete-file</kbd> and <kbd>M-x
delete-directory</kbd> (see <a href="Directories.html#Directories">Directories</a>), as well as the deletion
commands in Dired (see <a href="Dired-Deletion.html#Dired-Deletion">Dired Deletion</a>).  Supplying a prefix
argument to <kbd>M-x delete-file</kbd> or <kbd>M-x delete-directory</kbd> makes
them delete outright, instead of using the Trash, regardless of
<code>delete-by-moving-to-trash</code>.

   <p>If a file is under version control (see <a href="Version-Control.html#Version-Control">Version Control</a>), you
should delete it using <kbd>M-x vc-delete-file</kbd> instead of <kbd>M-x
delete-file</kbd>.  See <a href="VC-Delete_002fRename.html#VC-Delete_002fRename">VC Delete/Rename</a>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-i-1380"></a><a name="index-insert_002dfile-1381"></a>  <kbd>M-x insert-file</kbd> (also <kbd>C-x i</kbd>) inserts a copy of the
contents of the specified file into the current buffer at point,
leaving point unchanged before the contents.  The position after the
inserted contents is added to the mark ring, without activating the
mark (see <a href="Mark-Ring.html#Mark-Ring">Mark Ring</a>).

   <p><a name="index-insert_002dfile_002dliterally-1382"></a>  <kbd>M-x insert-file-literally</kbd> is like <kbd>M-x insert-file</kbd>,
except the file is inserted literally: it is treated as a sequence
of <acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters with no special encoding or conversion,
similar to the <kbd>M-x find-file-literally</kbd> command
(see <a href="Visiting.html#Visiting">Visiting</a>).

   <p><a name="index-write_002dregion-1383"></a>  <kbd>M-x write-region</kbd> is the inverse of <kbd>M-x insert-file</kbd>; it
copies the contents of the region into the specified file.  <kbd>M-x
append-to-file</kbd> adds the text of the region to the end of the
specified file.  See <a href="Accumulating-Text.html#Accumulating-Text">Accumulating Text</a>.  The variable
<code>write-region-inhibit-fsync</code> applies to these commands, as well
as saving files; see <a href="Customize-Save.html#Customize-Save">Customize Save</a>.

   <p><a name="index-set_002dfile_002dmodes-1384"></a><a name="index-file-modes-1385"></a><a name="index-file-permissions-1386"></a>  <kbd>M-x set-file-modes</kbd> reads a file name followed by a <dfn>file
mode</dfn>, and applies that file mode to the specified file.  File modes,
also called <dfn>file permissions</dfn>, determine whether a file can be
read, written to, or executed, and by whom.  This command reads file
modes using the same symbolic or octal format accepted by the
<samp><span class="command">chmod</span></samp> command; for instance, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">u+x</span></samp>&rsquo; means to add
execution permission for the user who owns the file.  It has no effect
on operating systems that do not support file modes.  <code>chmod</code> is a
convenience alias for this function.
