<h4 class="subsection">20.6.2 Displaying non-editable buffers.</h4>

<p><a name="index-temporary-windows-1617"></a>
Some buffers are shown in windows for perusal rather than for editing. 
Help commands (see <a href="Help.html#Help">Help</a>) typically use a buffer called <samp><span class="file">*Help*</span></samp>
for that purpose, minibuffer completion (see <a href="Completion.html#Completion">Completion</a>) uses a
buffer called <samp><span class="file">*Completions*</span></samp>, etc.  Such buffers are usually
displayed only for a short period of time.

   <p>Normally, Emacs chooses the window for such temporary displays via
<code>display-buffer</code>, as described in the previous subsection.  The
<samp><span class="file">*Completions*</span></samp> buffer, on the other hand, is normally displayed
in a window at the bottom of the selected frame, regardless of the
number of windows already shown on that frame.

   <p>If you prefer Emacs to display a temporary buffer in a different
fashion, customize the variable <code>display-buffer-alist</code>
(see <a href="../elisp/Choosing-Window.html#Choosing-Window">Choosing a Window for Displaying a Buffer</a>) appropriately.  For example,
to display <samp><span class="file">*Completions*</span></samp> always below the selected window, use
the following form in your initialization file (see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>):

<pre class="example">     (customize-set-variable
      'display-buffer-alist
      '(("\\*Completions\\*" display-buffer-below-selected)))
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-temp_002dbuffer_002dresize_002dmode-1618"></a>  The <samp><span class="file">*Completions*</span></samp> buffer is also special in the sense that
Emacs usually tries to make its window just as large as necessary to
display all of its contents.  To resize windows showing other
temporary displays, like, for example, the <samp><span class="file">*Help*</span></samp> buffer, turn
on the minor mode (see <a href="Minor-Modes.html#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>) <code>temp-buffer-resize-mode</code>
(see <a href="../elisp/Temporary-Displays.html#Temporary-Displays">Temporary Displays</a>).

   <p><a name="index-temp_002dbuffer_002dmax_002dheight-1619"></a><a name="index-temp_002dbuffer_002dmax_002dwidth-1620"></a>  The maximum size of windows resized by <code>temp-buffer-resize-mode</code>
can be controlled by customizing the options
<code>temp-buffer-max-height</code> and <code>temp-buffer-max-width</code>
(see <a href="../elisp/Temporary-Displays.html#Temporary-Displays">Temporary Displays</a>), and cannot exceed the size of the containing frame.
