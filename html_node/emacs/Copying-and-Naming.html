<h3 class="section">18.11 Copying, Naming and Renaming Files</h3>

<p>Emacs has several commands for copying, naming, and renaming files. 
All of them read two file names, <var>old</var> (or <var>target</var>) and
<var>new</var>, using the minibuffer, and then copy or adjust a file's name
accordingly; they do not accept wildcard file names.

   <p>In all these commands, if the argument <var>new</var> is just a directory
name (see <a href="../elisp/Directory-Names.html#Directory-Names">Directory Names</a>), the real new name is in that directory, with the same
non-directory component as <var>old</var>.  For example, the command
<kbd>M-x&nbsp;rename-file&nbsp;&lt;RET&gt;&nbsp;~/foo&nbsp;&lt;RET&gt;&nbsp;/tmp/&nbsp;&lt;RET&gt;</kbd><!-- /@w -->
renames <samp><span class="file">~/foo</span></samp> to <samp><span class="file">/tmp/foo</span></samp>.  On GNU and other POSIX-like
systems, directory names end in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>All these commands ask for confirmation when the new file name already
exists.

   <p><a name="index-copy_002dfile-1365"></a><a name="index-copying-files-1366"></a>  <kbd>M-x copy-file</kbd> copies the contents of the file <var>old</var> to the
file <var>new</var>.

   <p><a name="index-copy_002ddirectory-1367"></a>  <kbd>M-x copy-directory</kbd> copies directories, similar to the
<samp><span class="command">cp -r</span></samp> shell command.  If <var>new</var> is a directory name, it
creates a copy of the <var>old</var> directory and puts it in <var>new</var>. 
Otherwise it copies all the contents of <var>old</var> into a new directory
named <var>new</var>.

   <p><a name="index-renaming-files-1368"></a><a name="index-rename_002dfile-1369"></a>  <kbd>M-x rename-file</kbd> renames file <var>old</var> as <var>new</var>.  If the
file name <var>new</var> already exists, you must confirm with <kbd>yes</kbd> or
renaming is not done; this is because renaming causes the old meaning
of the name <var>new</var> to be lost.  If <var>old</var> and <var>new</var> are on
different file systems, the file <var>old</var> is copied and deleted.

   <p>If a file is under version control (see <a href="Version-Control.html#Version-Control">Version Control</a>), you
should rename it using <kbd>M-x&nbsp;vc-rename-file</kbd><!-- /@w --> instead of
<kbd>M-x&nbsp;rename-file</kbd><!-- /@w -->.  See <a href="VC-Delete_002fRename.html#VC-Delete_002fRename">VC Delete/Rename</a>.

   <p><a name="index-add_002dname_002dto_002dfile-1370"></a><a name="index-hard-links-_0028creation_0029-1371"></a>  <kbd>M-x add-name-to-file</kbd> adds an additional name to an existing
file without removing the old name.  The new name is created as a hard
link to the existing file.  The new name must belong on the same file
system that the file is on.  On MS-Windows, this command works only if
the file resides in an NTFS file system.  On MS-DOS, and some remote
system types, it works by copying the file.

   <p><a name="index-make_002dsymbolic_002dlink-1372"></a><a name="index-symbolic-links-_0028creation_0029-1373"></a>  <kbd>M-x make-symbolic-link</kbd> creates a symbolic link named
<var>new</var>, which points at <var>target</var>.  The effect is that future
attempts to open file <var>new</var> will refer to whatever file is named
<var>target</var> at the time the opening is done, or will get an error if
the name <var>target</var> is nonexistent at that time.  This command does
not expand the argument <var>target</var>, so that it allows you to specify
a relative name as the target of the link.  However, this command
does expand leading &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>&rsquo; in <var>target</var> so that you can easily
specify home directories, and strips leading &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/:</span></samp>&rsquo; so that you can
specify relative names beginning with literal &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/:</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
See <a href="Quoted-File-Names.html#Quoted-File-Names">Quoted File Names</a>.  On MS-Windows, this command works only on
MS Windows Vista and later.  When <var>new</var> is remote,
it works depending on the system type.
