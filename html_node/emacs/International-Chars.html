<h3 class="section">22.1 Introduction to International Character Sets</h3>

<p>The users of international character sets and scripts have
established many more-or-less standard coding systems for storing
files.  These coding systems are typically <dfn>multibyte</dfn>, meaning
that sequences of two or more bytes are used to represent individual
non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters.

   <p><a name="index-Unicode-1789"></a>  Internally, Emacs uses its own multibyte character encoding, which
is a superset of the <dfn>Unicode</dfn> standard.  This internal encoding
allows characters from almost every known script to be intermixed in a
single buffer or string.  Emacs translates between the multibyte
character encoding and various other coding systems when reading and
writing files, and when exchanging data with subprocesses.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dh-h-1790"></a><a name="index-view_002dhello_002dfile-1791"></a><a name="index-undisplayable-characters-1792"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_003f_007d-in-display-1793"></a>  The command <kbd>C-h h</kbd> (<code>view-hello-file</code>) displays the file
<samp><span class="file">etc/HELLO</span></samp>, which illustrates various scripts by showing
how to say &ldquo;hello&rdquo; in many languages.  If some characters can't be
displayed on your terminal, they appear as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; or as hollow boxes
(see <a href="Undisplayable-Characters.html#Undisplayable-Characters">Undisplayable Characters</a>).

   <p>Keyboards, even in the countries where these character sets are
used, generally don't have keys for all the characters in them.  You
can insert characters that your keyboard does not support, using
<kbd>C-x 8 &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> (<code>insert-char</code>).  See <a href="Inserting-Text.html#Inserting-Text">Inserting Text</a>. 
Shorthands are available for some common characters; for example, you
can insert a left single quotation mark <tt>‘</tt> by typing <kbd>C-x 8
[</kbd>, or in Electric Quote mode, usually by simply typing <kbd>`</kbd>. 
See <a href="Quotation-Marks.html#Quotation-Marks">Quotation Marks</a>.  Emacs also supports
various <dfn>input methods</dfn>, typically one for each script or
language, which make it easier to type characters in the script. 
See <a href="Input-Methods.html#Input-Methods">Input Methods</a>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-RET-1794"></a>  The prefix key <kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> is used for commands that pertain
to multibyte characters, coding systems, and input methods.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-_003d_0040r_007b_002c-and-international-characters_007d-1795"></a><a name="index-what_002dcursor_002dposition_0040r_007b_002c-and-international-characters_007d-1796"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x =</kbd> (<code>what-cursor-position</code>) shows
information about the character at point.  In addition to the
character position, which was described in <a href="Position-Info.html#Position-Info">Position Info</a>, this
command displays how the character is encoded.  For instance, it
displays the following line in the echo area for the character
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo;:

<pre class="smallexample">     Char: c (99, #o143, #x63) point=28062 of 36168 (78%) column=53
</pre>
   <p>The four values after &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Char:</span></samp>&rsquo; describe the character that
follows point, first by showing it and then by giving its character
code in decimal, octal and hex.  For a non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> multibyte
character, these are followed by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">file</span></samp>&rsquo; and the character's
representation, in hex, in the buffer's coding system, if that coding
system encodes the character safely and with a single byte
(see <a href="Coding-Systems.html#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>).  If the character's encoding is longer than
one byte, Emacs shows &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">file ...</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p><a name="index-eight_002dbit-character-set-1797"></a><a name="index-raw-bytes-1798"></a>  On rare occasions, Emacs encounters <dfn>raw bytes</dfn>: single bytes
whose values are in the range 128 (0200 octal) through 255 (0377
octal), which Emacs cannot interpret as part of a known encoding of
some non-ASCII character.  Such raw bytes are treated as if they
belonged to a special character set <code>eight-bit</code>; Emacs displays
them as escaped octal codes (this can be customized; see <a href="Display-Custom.html#Display-Custom">Display Custom</a>).  In this case, <kbd>C-x =</kbd> shows &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">raw-byte</span></samp>&rsquo; instead of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">file</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In addition, <kbd>C-x =</kbd> shows the character codes of
raw bytes as if they were in the range <code>#x3FFF80..#x3FFFFF</code>,
which is where Emacs maps them to distinguish them from Unicode
characters in the range <code>#x0080..#x00FF</code>.

   <p><a name="index-character-set-of-character-at-point-1799"></a><a name="index-font-of-character-at-point-1800"></a><a name="index-text-properties-at-point-1801"></a><a name="index-face-at-point-1802"></a>  With a prefix argument (<kbd>C-u C-x =</kbd>), this command displays a
detailed description of the character in a window:

     <ul>
<li>The character set name, and the codes that identify the character
within that character set; <acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters are identified
as belonging to the <code>ascii</code> character set.

     <li>The character's script, syntax and categories.

     <li>What keys to type to input the character in the current input method
(if it supports the character).

     <li>The character's encodings, both internally in the buffer, and externally
if you were to save the file.

     <li>If you are running Emacs on a graphical display, the font name and
glyph code for the character.  If you are running Emacs on a text
terminal, the code(s) sent to the terminal.

     <li>The character's text properties (see <a href="../elisp/Text-Properties.html#Text-Properties">Text Properties</a>), including any non-default
faces used to display the character, and any overlays containing it
(see <a href="../elisp/Overlays.html#Overlays">Overlays</a>). 
</ul>

   <p>Here's an example, with some lines folded to fit into this manual:
