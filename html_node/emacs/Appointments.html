<h4 class="subsection">31.10.6 Appointments</h4>

<p><a name="index-appointment-notification-3750"></a>
<a name="index-appt_002ddisplay_002dformat-3751"></a><a name="index-appt_002daudible-3752"></a><a name="index-appt_002ddisplay_002dmode_002dline-3753"></a>  If you have a diary entry for an appointment, and that diary entry
begins with a recognizable time of day, Emacs can warn you in advance
that an appointment is pending.  Emacs alerts you
to the appointment by displaying a message in your chosen format, as
specified by the variable <code>appt-display-format</code>.  If the value of
<code>appt-audible</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, the warning includes an audible
reminder.  In addition, if <code>appt-display-mode-line</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, Emacs displays the number of minutes to the
appointment on the mode line.

   <p><a name="index-appt_002ddisplay_002dduration-3754"></a><a name="index-appt_002ddisp_002dwindow_002dfunction-3755"></a><a name="index-appt_002ddelete_002dwindow_002dfunction-3756"></a>  If <code>appt-display-format</code> has the value <code>window</code>, then the
variable <code>appt-display-duration</code> controls how long the reminder
window is visible for; and the variables
<code>appt-disp-window-function</code> and <code>appt-delete-window-function</code>
give the names of functions used to create and destroy the window,
respectively.

   <p><a name="index-appt_002dactivate-3757"></a>  To enable appointment notification, type <kbd>M-x appt-activate</kbd>. 
With a positive argument, it enables notification; with a negative
argument, it disables notification; with no argument, it toggles. 
Enabling notification also sets up an appointment list for today from
the diary file, giving all diary entries found with recognizable times
of day, and reminds you just before each of them.

   <p>For example, suppose the diary file contains these lines:

<pre class="example">     Monday
       9:30am Coffee break
      12:00pm Lunch
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-appt_002dmessage_002dwarning_002dtime-3758"></a><a name="index-appt_002dwarning_002dtime_002dregexp-3759"></a>Then on Mondays, you will be reminded at around 9:20am about your
coffee break and at around 11:50am about lunch.  The variable
<code>appt-message-warning-time</code> specifies how many minutes (default 12)
in advance to warn you.  This is a default warning time.  Each
appointment can specify a different warning time by adding a piece
matching <code>appt-warning-time-regexp</code> (see that variable's
documentation for details).

   <p>You can write times in am/pm style (with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">12:00am</span></samp>&rsquo; standing
for midnight and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">12:00pm</span></samp>&rsquo; standing for noon), or 24-hour
European/military style.  You need not be consistent; your diary file
can have a mixture of the two styles.  Times must be at the beginning of
diary entries if they are to be recognized.

   <p><a name="index-appt_002ddisplay_002ddiary-3760"></a>  Emacs updates the appointments list from the diary file
automatically just after midnight.  You can force an update at any
time by re-enabling appointment notification.  Both these actions also
display the day's diary buffer, unless you set
<code>appt-display-diary</code> to <code>nil</code>.  The appointments list is
also updated whenever the diary file (or a file it includes; see
<a href="Fancy-Diary-Display.html#Fancy-Diary-Display">Fancy Diary Display</a>)
is saved.  If you use the Org Mode and keep appointments in your Org
agenda files, you can add those appointments to the list using the
<code>org-agenda-to-appt</code> command.  See <a href="../org/Weekly_002fdaily-agenda.html#Weekly_002fdaily-agenda">Appointment reminders</a>, for more about that
command.

   <p><a name="index-appt_002dadd-3761"></a><a name="index-appt_002ddelete-3762"></a><a name="index-alarm-clock-3763"></a>  You can also use the appointment notification facility like an alarm
clock.  The command <kbd>M-x appt-add</kbd> adds entries to the appointment
list without affecting your diary file.  You delete entries from the
appointment list with <kbd>M-x appt-delete</kbd>.
