<h3 class="section">8.5 Minibuffer History</h3>

<p><a name="index-minibuffer-history-230"></a><a name="index-history-of-minibuffer-input-231"></a>
  Every argument that you enter with the minibuffer is saved in a
<dfn>minibuffer history list</dfn> so you can easily use it again later. 
You can use the following arguments to quickly fetch an earlier
argument into the minibuffer:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-p</kbd><dd>Move to the previous item in the minibuffer history, an earlier
argument (<code>previous-history-element</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-n</kbd><dd>Move to the next item in the minibuffer history
(<code>next-history-element</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>&lt;UP&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;DOWN&gt;</kbd><dd>Like <kbd>M-p</kbd> and <kbd>M-n</kbd>, but move to the previous or next line of
a multi-line item before going to the previous history item
(<code>previous-line-or-history-element</code> and
<code>next-line-or-history-element</code>) . 
<br><dt><kbd>M-r </kbd><var>regexp</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Move to an earlier item in the minibuffer history that
matches <var>regexp</var> (<code>previous-matching-history-element</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-s </kbd><var>regexp</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Move to a later item in the minibuffer history that matches
<var>regexp</var> (<code>next-matching-history-element</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-M_002dp-_0040r_007b_0028minibuffer-history_0029_007d-232"></a><a name="index-M_002dn-_0040r_007b_0028minibuffer-history_0029_007d-233"></a><a name="index-next_002dhistory_002delement-234"></a><a name="index-previous_002dhistory_002delement-235"></a>  While in the minibuffer, <kbd>M-p</kbd> (<code>previous-history-element</code>)
moves through the minibuffer history list, one item at a time.  Each
<kbd>M-p</kbd> fetches an earlier item from the history list into the
minibuffer, replacing its existing contents.  Typing <kbd>M-n</kbd>
(<code>next-history-element</code>) moves through the minibuffer history
list in the opposite direction, fetching later entries into the
minibuffer.

   <p>If you type <kbd>M-n</kbd> in the minibuffer when there are no later
entries in the minibuffer history (e.g., if you haven't previously
typed <kbd>M-p</kbd>), Emacs tries fetching from a list of default
arguments: values that you are likely to enter.  You can think of this
as moving through the &ldquo;future history&rdquo;.

   <p><a name="index-future-history-for-file-names-236"></a><a name="index-minibuffer-defaults-for-file-names-237"></a><a name="index-file_002dname_002dat_002dpoint_002dfunctions-238"></a>  The &ldquo;future history&rdquo; for file names includes several possible
alternatives you may find useful, such as the file name or the URL at
point in the current buffer.  The defaults put into the &ldquo;future
history&rdquo; in this case are controlled by the functions mentioned in
the value of the option <code>file-name-at-point-functions</code>.  By
default, its value invokes the <code>ffap</code> package (see <a href="FFAP.html#FFAP">FFAP</a>),
which tries to guess the default file or URL from the text around
point.  To disable this guessing, customize the option to a <code>nil</code>
value, then the &ldquo;future history&rdquo; of file names will include only the
file, if any, visited by the current buffer, and the default
directory.

   <p><a name="index-previous_002dline_002dor_002dhistory_002delement-239"></a><a name="index-next_002dline_002dor_002dhistory_002delement-240"></a><a name="index-UP-_0040r_007b_0028minibuffer-history_0029_007d-241"></a><a name="index-DOWN-_0040r_007b_0028minibuffer-history_0029_007d-242"></a>  The arrow keys <kbd>&lt;UP&gt;</kbd> and <kbd>&lt;DOWN&gt;</kbd> work like
<kbd>M-p</kbd> and <kbd>M-n</kbd>, but if the current history item is longer
than a single line, they allow you to move to the previous or next
line of the current history item before going to the previous or next
history item.

   <p>If you edit the text inserted by the <kbd>M-p</kbd> or <kbd>M-n</kbd>
minibuffer history commands, this does not change its entry in the
history list.  However, the edited argument does go at the end of the
history list when you submit it.

   <p><a name="index-previous_002dmatching_002dhistory_002delement-243"></a><a name="index-next_002dmatching_002dhistory_002delement-244"></a><a name="index-M_002dr-_0040r_007b_0028minibuffer-history_0029_007d-245"></a><a name="index-M_002ds-_0040r_007b_0028minibuffer-history_0029_007d-246"></a>  You can use <kbd>M-r</kbd> (<code>previous-matching-history-element</code>) to
search through older elements in the history list, and <kbd>M-s</kbd>
(<code>next-matching-history-element</code>) to search through newer
entries.  Each of these commands asks for a <dfn>regular expression</dfn>
as an argument, and fetches the first matching entry into the
minibuffer.  See <a href="Regexps.html#Regexps">Regexps</a>, for an explanation of regular
expressions.  A numeric prefix argument <var>n</var> means to fetch the
<var>n</var>th matching entry.  These commands are unusual, in that they
use the minibuffer to read the regular expression argument, even
though they are invoked from the minibuffer.  An upper-case letter in
the regular expression makes the search case-sensitive (see <a href="Lax-Search.html#Lax-Search">Lax Search</a>).

   <p>You can also search through the history using an incremental search. 
See <a href="Isearch-Minibuffer.html#Isearch-Minibuffer">Isearch Minibuffer</a>.

   <p>Emacs keeps separate history lists for several different kinds of
arguments.  For example, there is a list for file names, used by all
the commands that read file names.  Other history lists include buffer
names, command names (used by <kbd>M-x</kbd>), and command arguments (used
by commands like <code>query-replace</code>).

   <p><a name="index-history_002dlength-247"></a>  The variable <code>history-length</code> specifies the maximum length of a
minibuffer history list; adding a new element deletes the oldest
element if the list gets too long.  If the value is <code>t</code>, there is
no maximum length.

   <p><a name="index-history_002ddelete_002dduplicates-248"></a>  The variable <code>history-delete-duplicates</code> specifies whether to
delete duplicates in history.  If it is non-<code>nil</code>, adding a new
element deletes from the list all other elements that are equal to it. 
The default is <code>nil</code>.
