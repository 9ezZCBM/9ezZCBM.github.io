  <dfn>Hiding</dfn> a subdirectory means to make it invisible, except for its
header line.

<dt><kbd>$</kbd><dd><a name="index-dired_002dhide_002dsubdir-3517"></a><a name="index-g_t_0024-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3518"></a>Hide or show the subdirectory that point is in, and move point to the
next subdirectory (<code>dired-hide-subdir</code>).  This is a toggle.  A
numeric argument serves as a repeat count.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-$</kbd><dd><a name="index-dired_002dhide_002dall-3519"></a><a name="index-M_002d_0024-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3520"></a>Hide all subdirectories in this Dired buffer, leaving only their header
lines (<code>dired-hide-all</code>).  Or, if any subdirectory is currently
hidden, make all subdirectories visible again.  You can use this command
to get an overview in very deep directory trees or to move quickly to
subdirectories far away. 
</dl>

   <p>Ordinary Dired commands never consider files inside a hidden
subdirectory.  For example, the commands to operate on marked files
ignore files in hidden directories even if they are marked.  Thus you
can use hiding to temporarily exclude subdirectories from operations
without having to remove the Dired marks on files in those
subdirectories.

   <p>See <a href="Subdirectories-in-Dired.html#Subdirectories-in-Dired">Subdirectories in Dired</a>, for how to insert a subdirectory
listing, and see <a href="Dired-Updating.html#Dired-Updating">Dired Updating</a>, for how to delete it.
