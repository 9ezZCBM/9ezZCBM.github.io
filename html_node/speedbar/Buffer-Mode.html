<h2 class="chapter">4 Buffer Mode</h2>

<p><a name="index-buffer-mode-22"></a>
Buffer mode is very similar to File mode, except that instead of
tracking the current directory and all files available there, the
current list of Emacs buffers is shown.

   <p>These buffers can have their tags expanded in the same way as files,
and uses the same unknown file indicator (see <a href="File-Mode.html#File-Mode">File Mode</a>).

   <p>Buffer mode does not have file operation bindings, but the following
buffer specific key bindings are available:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>k</kbd><dd>Kill this buffer.  Do not touch its file. 
<br><dt><kbd>r</kbd><dd>Revert this buffer, reloading from disk. 
</dl>

   <p>In addition to Buffer mode, there is also Quick Buffer mode.  In fact,
Quick Buffers is bound to the <kbd>b</kbd> key.  The only difference between
Buffers and Quick Buffers is that after one operation  is performed
which affects the attached frame, the display is immediately reverted to
the last displayed mode.

   <p>Thus, if you are in File mode, and you need quick access to a buffer,
press <kbd>b</kbd>, click on the buffer you want, and speedbar will revert
back to File mode.
