<h2 class="unnumbered">Speedbar</h2>

<p>Speedbar is a program for Emacs which can be used to summarize
information related to the current buffer.  Its original inspiration
is the &ldquo;explorer&rdquo; often used in modern development environments, office
packages, and web browsers.

   <p>Speedbar displays a narrow frame in which a tree view is shown.  This
tree view defaults to containing a list of files and directories.  Files
can be &ldquo;expanded&rdquo; to list tags inside. Directories can be expanded to
list the files within them.  Each file or tag can be jumped to
immediately.

   <p>Speedbar expands upon &ldquo;explorer&rdquo; windows by maintaining context with the
user.  For example, when using the file view, the current buffer's file
is highlighted.  Speedbar also mimics the explorer windows by providing
multiple display modes.  These modes come in two flavors.  Major display
modes remain consistent across buffers, and minor display modes appear
only when a buffer of the applicable type is shown.  This allows
authors of other packages to provide speedbar summaries customized to
the needs of that mode.

   <p>Throughout this manual, activities are defined as &ldquo;clicking on&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;expanding&rdquo; items.  Clicking means using <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> on a
button.  Expanding refers to clicking on an expansion button to display
an expanded summary of the entry the expansion button is
on.  See <a href="Basic-Navigation.html#Basic-Navigation">Basic Navigation</a>.
