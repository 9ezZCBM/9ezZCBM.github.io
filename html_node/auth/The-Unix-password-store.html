<h2 class="chapter">5 The Unix password store</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.passwordstore.org">The standard unix password manager</a> (or just <code>pass</code>) stores your passwords in
<code>gpg</code>-protected files following the Unix philosophy.

   <p>Emacs integration of <code>pass</code> follows the first approach suggested
by the pass project itself for data organization to find data. This
means that the filename of the file containing the password for a user
on a particular host must contain the host name.  The file itself must
contain the password on the first line, as well as a <code>username</code>
field containing the username on a subsequent line. A <code>port</code>
field can be used to differentiate the authentication data for several
services with the same username on the same host.

   <p>Users of <code>pass</code> may also be interested in functionality provided
by other Emacs packages dealing with pass:

     <ul>
<li><a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/tree/contrib/emacs/password-store.el">password-store</a>: library wrapping <code>pass</code>;
<li><a href="https://github.com/NicolasPetton/pass">pass</a>: major mode to manipulate the store and edit entries;
<li><a href="https://github.com/jabranham/helm-pass">helm-pass</a>: helm interface for pass. 
</ul>
