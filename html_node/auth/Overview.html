<h2 class="chapter">1 Overview</h2>

<p>The auth-source library is simply a way for Emacs and Gnus, among
others, to answer the old burning question &ldquo;What are my user name and
password?&rdquo;

   <p>(This is different from the old question about burning &ldquo;Where is the
fire extinguisher, please?&rdquo;.)

   <p>The auth-source library supports more than just the user name or the
password (known as the secret).

   <p>Similarly, the auth-source library supports multiple storage backend,
currently either the classic &ldquo;netrc&rdquo; backend, examples of which you
can see later in this document, the Secret Service API, and pass, the
standard unix password manager.  This is done with EIEIO-based
backends and you can write your own if you want.
