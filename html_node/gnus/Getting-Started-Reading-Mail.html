<h4 class="subsection">6.4.2 Getting Started Reading Mail</h4>

<p>It's quite easy to use Gnus to read your new mail.  You just plonk the
mail back end of your choice into <code>gnus-secondary-select-methods</code>,
and things will happen automatically.

   <p>For instance, if you want to use <code>nnml</code> (which is a &ldquo;one file per
mail&rdquo; back end), you could put the following in your <samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp> file:

<pre class="lisp">     (setq gnus-secondary-select-methods '((nnml "")))
</pre>
   <p>Now, the next time you start Gnus, this back end will be queried for new
articles, and it will move all the messages in your spool file to its
directory, which is <samp><span class="file">~/Mail/</span></samp> by default.  The new group that will
be created (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mail.misc</span></samp>&rsquo;) will be subscribed, and you can read it
like any other group.

   <p>You will probably want to split the mail into several groups, though:

<pre class="lisp">     (setq nnmail-split-methods
           '(("junk" "^From:.*Lars Ingebrigtsen")
             ("crazy" "^Subject:.*die\\|^Organization:.*flabby")
             ("other" "")))
</pre>
   <p>This will result in three new <code>nnml</code> mail groups being created:
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nnml:junk</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nnml:crazy</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nnml:other</span></samp>&rsquo;.  All the
mail that doesn't fit into the first two groups will be placed in the
last group.

   <p>This should be sufficient for reading mail with Gnus.  You might want to
give the other sections in this part of the manual a perusal, though.
