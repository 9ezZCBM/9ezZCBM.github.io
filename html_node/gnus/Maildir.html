<h5 class="subsubsection">6.4.13.5 Maildir</h5>

<p><a name="index-nnmaildir-2199"></a><a name="index-maildir-2200"></a>
<code>nnmaildir</code> stores mail in the maildir format, with each maildir
corresponding to a group in Gnus.  This format is documented here:
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/proto/maildir.html">http://cr.yp.to/proto/maildir.html</a> and here:
<a href="http://www.qmail.org/man/man5/maildir.html">http://www.qmail.org/man/man5/maildir.html</a>.  <code>nnmaildir</code>
also stores extra information in the <samp><span class="file">.nnmaildir/</span></samp> directory
within a maildir.

   <p>Maildir format was designed to allow concurrent deliveries and
reading, without needing locks.  With other back ends, you would have
your mail delivered to a spool of some kind, and then you would
configure Gnus to split mail from that spool into your groups.  You
can still do that with <code>nnmaildir</code>, but the more common
configuration is to have your mail delivered directly to the maildirs
that appear as group in Gnus.

   <p><code>nnmaildir</code> is designed to be perfectly reliable: <kbd>C-g</kbd> will
never corrupt its data in memory, and <code>SIGKILL</code> will never
corrupt its data in the filesystem.

   <p><code>nnmaildir</code> stores article marks and <acronym>NOV</acronym> data in each
maildir.  So you can copy a whole maildir from one Gnus setup to
another, and you will keep your marks.

   <p>Virtual server settings:

     <dl>
<dt><code>directory</code><dd>For each of your <code>nnmaildir</code> servers (it's very unlikely that
you'd need more than one), you need to create a directory and populate
it with maildirs or symlinks to maildirs (and nothing else; do not
choose a directory already used for other purposes).  Each maildir
will be represented in Gnus as a newsgroup on that server; the
filename of the symlink will be the name of the group.  Any filenames
in the directory starting with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; are ignored.  The directory is
scanned when you first start Gnus, and each time you type <kbd>g</kbd> in
the group buffer; if any maildirs have been removed or added,
<code>nnmaildir</code> notices at these times.

     <p>The value of the <code>directory</code> parameter should be a Lisp form
which is processed by <code>eval</code> and <code>expand-file-name</code> to get
the path of the directory for this server.  The form is <code>eval</code>ed
only when the server is opened; the resulting string is used until the
server is closed.  (If you don't know about forms and <code>eval</code>,
don't worry&mdash;a simple string will work.)  This parameter is not
optional; you must specify it.  I don't recommend using
<code>"~/Mail"</code> or a subdirectory of it; several other parts of Gnus
use that directory by default for various things, and may get confused
if <code>nnmaildir</code> uses it too.  <code>"~/.nnmaildir"</code> is a typical
value.

     <br><dt><code>target-prefix</code><dd>This should be a Lisp form which is processed by <code>eval</code> and
<code>expand-file-name</code>.  The form is <code>eval</code>ed only when the
server is opened; the resulting string is used until the server is
closed.

     <p>When you create a group on an <code>nnmaildir</code> server, the maildir is
created with <code>target-prefix</code> prepended to its name, and a symlink
pointing to that maildir is created, named with the plain group name. 
So if <code>directory</code> is <code>"~/.nnmaildir"</code> and
<code>target-prefix</code> is <code>"../maildirs/"</code>, then when you create
the group <code>foo</code>, <code>nnmaildir</code> will create
<samp><span class="file">~/.nnmaildir/../maildirs/foo</span></samp> as a maildir, and will create
<samp><span class="file">~/.nnmaildir/foo</span></samp> as a symlink pointing to
<samp><span class="file">../maildirs/foo</span></samp>.

     <p>You can set <code>target-prefix</code> to a string without any slashes to
create both maildirs and symlinks in the same <code>directory</code>; in
this case, any maildirs found in <code>directory</code> whose names start
with <code>target-prefix</code> will not be listed as groups (but the
symlinks pointing to them will be).

     <p>As a special case, if <code>target-prefix</code> is <code>""</code> (the default),
then when you create a group, the maildir will be created in
<code>directory</code> without a corresponding symlink.  Beware that you
cannot use <code>gnus-group-delete-group</code> on such groups without the
<code>force</code> argument.

     <br><dt><code>directory-files</code><dd>This should be a function with the same interface as
<code>directory-files</code> (such as <code>directory-files</code> itself).  It is
used to scan the server's <code>directory</code> for maildirs.  This
parameter is optional; the default is
<code>nnheader-directory-files-safe</code> if
<code>nnheader-directory-files-is-safe</code> is <code>nil</code>, and
<code>directory-files</code> otherwise. 
(<code>nnheader-directory-files-is-safe</code> is checked only once when the
server is opened; if you want to check it each time the directory is
scanned, you'll have to provide your own function that does that.)

     <br><dt><code>get-new-mail</code><dd>If non-<code>nil</code>, then after scanning for new mail in the group
maildirs themselves as usual, this server will also incorporate mail
the conventional Gnus way, from <code>mail-sources</code> according to
<code>nnmail-split-methods</code> or <code>nnmail-split-fancy</code>.  The default
value is <code>nil</code>.

     <p>Do <em>not</em> use the same maildir both in <code>mail-sources</code> and as
an <code>nnmaildir</code> group.  The results might happen to be useful, but
that would be by chance, not by design, and the results might be
different in the future.  If your split rules create new groups,
remember to supply a <code>create-directory</code> server parameter.
