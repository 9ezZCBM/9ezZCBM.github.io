<h3 class="section">6.8 Email Based Diary</h3>

<p><a name="index-diary-2272"></a><a name="index-email-based-diary-2273"></a><a name="index-calendar-2274"></a>
This section describes a special mail back end called <code>nndiary</code>,
and its companion library <code>gnus-diary</code>.  It is &ldquo;special&rdquo; in the
sense that it is not meant to be one of the standard alternatives for
reading mail with Gnus.  See <a href="Choosing-a-Mail-Back-End.html#Choosing-a-Mail-Back-End">Choosing a Mail Back End</a> for that. 
Instead, it is used to treat <em>some</em> of your mails in a special way,
namely, as event reminders.

   <p>Here is a typical scenario:

     <ul>
<li>You've got a date with Andy Mc Dowell or Bruce Willis (select according
to your sexual preference) in one month.  You don't want to forget it. 
<li>So you send a &ldquo;reminder&rdquo; message (actually, a diary one) to yourself. 
<li>You forget all about it and keep on getting and reading new mail, as usual. 
<li>From time to time, as you type <kbd>g</kbd> in the group buffer and as the date
is getting closer, the message will pop up again to remind you of your
appointment, just as if it were new and unread. 
<li>Read your &ldquo;new&rdquo; messages, this one included, and start dreaming again
of the night you're gonna have. 
<li>Once the date is over (you actually fell asleep just after dinner), the
message will be automatically deleted if it is marked as expirable. 
</ul>

   <p>The Gnus Diary back end has the ability to handle regular appointments
(that wouldn't ever be deleted) as well as punctual ones, operates as a
real mail back end and is configurable in many ways.  All of this is
explained in the sections below.
