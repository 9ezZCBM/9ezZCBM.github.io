<dt><dfn>Crossposts</dfn><dd><a name="index-crossposts-2495"></a><a name="index-scoring-crossposts-2496"></a>If you want to lower the score of crossposts, the line to match on is
the <code>Xref</code> header.
     <pre class="lisp">          ("xref" (" talk.politics.misc:" -1000))
</pre>
     <br><dt><dfn>Multiple crossposts</dfn><dd>If you want to lower the score of articles that have been crossposted to
more than, say, 3 groups:
     <pre class="lisp">          ("xref"
            ("[^:\n]+:[0-9]+ +[^:\n]+:[0-9]+ +[^:\n]+:[0-9]+"
             -1000 nil r))
</pre>
     <br><dt><dfn>Matching on the body</dfn><dd>This is generally not a very good idea&mdash;it takes a very long time. 
Gnus actually has to fetch each individual article from the server.  But
you might want to anyway, I guess.  Even though there are three match
keys (<code>Head</code>, <code>Body</code> and <code>All</code>), you should choose one
and stick with it in each score file.  If you use any two, each article
will be fetched <em>twice</em>.  If you want to match a bit on the
<code>Head</code> and a bit on the <code>Body</code>, just use <code>All</code> for all
the matches.

     <br><dt><dfn>Marking as read</dfn><dd>You will probably want to mark articles that have scores below a certain
number as read.  This is most easily achieved by putting the following
in your <samp><span class="file">all.SCORE</span></samp> file:
     <pre class="lisp">          ((mark -100))
</pre>
     <p>You may also consider doing something similar with <code>expunge</code>.

     <br><dt><dfn>Negated character classes</dfn><dd>If you say stuff like <code>[^abcd]*</code>, you may get unexpected results. 
That will match newlines, which might lead to, well, The Unknown.  Say
<code>[^abcd\n]*</code> instead.
