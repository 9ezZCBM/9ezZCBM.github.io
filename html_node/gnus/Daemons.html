<h3 class="section">9.9 Daemons</h3>

<p><a name="index-demons-2624"></a><a name="index-daemons-2625"></a>
Gnus, being larger than any program ever written (allegedly), does lots
of strange stuff that you may wish to have done while you're not
present.  For instance, you may want it to check for new mail once in a
while.  Or you may want it to close down all connections to all servers
when you leave Emacs idle.  And stuff like that.

   <p>Gnus will let you do stuff like that by defining various
<dfn>handlers</dfn>.  Each handler consists of three elements:  A
<var>function</var>, a <var>time</var>, and an <var>idle</var> parameter.

   <p>Here's an example of a handler that closes connections when Emacs has
been idle for thirty minutes:

<pre class="lisp">     (gnus-demon-close-connections nil 30)
</pre>
   <p>Here's a handler that scans for <acronym>PGP</acronym> headers every hour when
Emacs is idle:

<pre class="lisp">     (gnus-demon-scan-pgp 60 t)
</pre>
   <p>This <var>time</var> parameter and that <var>idle</var> parameter work together
in a strange, but wonderful fashion.  Basically, if <var>idle</var> is
<code>nil</code>, then the function will be called every <var>time</var> minutes.

   <p>If <var>idle</var> is <code>t</code>, then the function will be called after
<var>time</var> minutes only if Emacs is idle.  So if Emacs is never idle,
the function will never be called.  But once Emacs goes idle, the
function will be called every <var>time</var> minutes.

   <p>If <var>idle</var> is a number and <var>time</var> is a number, the function will
be called every <var>time</var> minutes only when Emacs has been idle for
<var>idle</var> minutes.

   <p>If <var>idle</var> is a number and <var>time</var> is <code>nil</code>, the function
will be called once every time Emacs has been idle for <var>idle</var>
minutes.

   <p>And if <var>time</var> is a string, it should look like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">07:31</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
the function will then be called once every day somewhere near that
time.  Modified by the <var>idle</var> parameter, of course.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002ddemon_002dtimestep-2626"></a>(When I say &ldquo;minute&rdquo; here, I really mean <code>gnus-demon-timestep</code>
seconds.  This is 60 by default.  If you change that variable,
all the timings in the handlers will be affected.)

   <p>So, if you want to add a handler, you could put something like this in
your <samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp> file:

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002ddemon_002dadd_002dhandler-2627"></a>
<pre class="lisp">     (gnus-demon-add-handler 'gnus-demon-close-connections 30 t)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-gnus_002ddemon_002dadd_002dscanmail-2628"></a><a name="index-gnus_002ddemon_002dadd_002drescan-2629"></a><a name="index-gnus_002ddemon_002dadd_002dscan_002dtimestamps-2630"></a><a name="index-gnus_002ddemon_002dadd_002ddisconnection-2631"></a>Some ready-made functions to do this have been created:
<code>gnus-demon-add-disconnection</code>,
<code>gnus-demon-add-nntp-close-connection</code>,
<code>gnus-demon-add-scan-timestamps</code>, <code>gnus-demon-add-rescan</code>, and
<code>gnus-demon-add-scanmail</code>.  Just put those functions in your
<samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp> if you want those abilities.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002ddemon_002dinit-2632"></a><a name="index-gnus_002ddemon_002dcancel-2633"></a><a name="index-gnus_002ddemon_002dhandlers-2634"></a>If you add handlers to <code>gnus-demon-handlers</code> directly, you should
run <code>gnus-demon-init</code> to make the changes take hold.  To cancel all
daemons, you can use the <code>gnus-demon-cancel</code> function.

   <p>Note that adding daemons can be pretty naughty if you over do it.  Adding
functions that scan all news and mail from all servers every two seconds
is a sure-fire way of getting booted off any respectable system.  So
behave.
