<h4 class="subsection">3.24.1 Pick and Read</h4>

<p><a name="index-pick-and-read-1547"></a>
Some newsreaders (like <code>nn</code> and, uhm, <code>Netnews</code> on VM/CMS) use
a two-phased reading interface.  The user first marks in a summary
buffer the articles she wants to read.  Then she starts reading the
articles with just an article buffer displayed.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dpick_002dmode-1548"></a>Gnus provides a summary buffer minor mode that allows
this&mdash;<code>gnus-pick-mode</code>.  This basically means that a few process
mark commands become one-keystroke commands to allow easy marking, and
it provides one additional command for switching to the summary buffer.

   <p>Here are the available keystrokes when using pick mode:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>.</kbd><dd><a name="index-g_t_002e-_0040r_007b_0028Pick_0029_007d-1549"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dpick_002darticle_002dor_002dthread-1550"></a>Pick the article or thread on the current line
(<code>gnus-pick-article-or-thread</code>).  If the variable
<code>gnus-thread-hide-subtree</code> is true, then this key selects the
entire thread when used at the first article of the thread.  Otherwise,
it selects just the article.  If given a numerical prefix, go to that
thread or article and pick it.  (The line number is normally displayed
at the beginning of the summary pick lines.)

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-SPC-_0040r_007b_0028Pick_0029_007d-1551"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dpick_002dnext_002dpage-1552"></a>Scroll the summary buffer up one page (<code>gnus-pick-next-page</code>).  If
at the end of the buffer, start reading the picked articles.

     <br><dt><kbd>u</kbd><dd><a name="index-u-_0040r_007b_0028Pick_0029_007d-1553"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dpick_002dunmark_002darticle_002dor_002dthread_002e-1554"></a>Unpick the thread or article
(<code>gnus-pick-unmark-article-or-thread</code>).  If the variable
<code>gnus-thread-hide-subtree</code> is true, then this key unpicks the
thread if used at the first article of the thread.  Otherwise it unpicks
just the article.  You can give this key a numerical prefix to unpick
the thread or article at that line.

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-RET-_0040r_007b_0028Pick_0029_007d-1555"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dpick_002dstart_002dreading-1556"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dpick_002ddisplay_002dsummary-1557"></a>Start reading the picked articles (<code>gnus-pick-start-reading</code>).  If
given a prefix, mark all unpicked articles as read first.  If
<code>gnus-pick-display-summary</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, the summary buffer
will still be visible when you are reading.

   </dl>

   <p>All the normal summary mode commands are still available in the
pick-mode, with the exception of <kbd>u</kbd>.  However <kbd>!</kbd> is available
which is mapped to the same function
<code>gnus-summary-tick-article-forward</code>.

   <p>If this sounds like a good idea to you, you could say:

<pre class="lisp">     (add-hook 'gnus-summary-mode-hook 'gnus-pick-mode)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dpick_002dmode_002dhook-1558"></a><code>gnus-pick-mode-hook</code> is run in pick minor mode buffers.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dmark_002dunpicked_002darticles_002das_002dread-1559"></a>If <code>gnus-mark-unpicked-articles-as-read</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, mark
all unpicked articles as read.  The default is <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dsummary_002dpick_002dline_002dformat-1560"></a>The summary line format in pick mode is slightly different from the
standard format.  At the beginning of each line the line number is
displayed.  The pick mode line format is controlled by the
<code>gnus-summary-pick-line-format</code> variable (see <a href="Formatting-Variables.html#Formatting-Variables">Formatting Variables</a>).  It accepts the same format specs that
<code>gnus-summary-line-format</code> does (see <a href="Summary-Buffer-Lines.html#Summary-Buffer-Lines">Summary Buffer Lines</a>).
