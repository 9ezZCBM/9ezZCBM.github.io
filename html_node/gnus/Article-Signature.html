<p><a name="index-signatures-1433"></a><a name="index-article-signature-1434"></a>
<a name="index-gnus_002dsignature_002dseparator-1435"></a>Each article is divided into two parts&mdash;the head and the body.  The
body can be divided into a signature part and a text part.  The variable
that says what is to be considered a signature is
<code>gnus-signature-separator</code>.  This is normally the standard
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^-- $</span></samp>&rsquo; as mandated by RFC 5536.  However, many people use
non-standard signature separators, so this variable can also be a list
of regular expressions to be tested, one by one.  (Searches are done
from the end of the body towards the beginning.)  One likely value is:

<pre class="lisp">     (setq gnus-signature-separator
           '("^-- $"         ; <span class="roman">The standard</span>
             "^-- *$"        ; <span class="roman">A common mangling</span>
             "^-------*$"    ; <span class="roman">Many people just use a looong</span>
                             ; <span class="roman">line of dashes.  Shame!</span>
             "^ *--------*$" ; <span class="roman">Double-shame!</span>
             "^________*$"   ; <span class="roman">Underscores are also popular</span>
             "^========*$")) ; <span class="roman">Pervert!</span>
</pre>
   <p>The more permissive you are, the more likely it is that you'll get false
positives.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dsignature_002dlimit-1436"></a><code>gnus-signature-limit</code> provides a limit to what is considered a
signature when displaying articles.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>If it is an integer, no signature may be longer (in characters) than
that integer. 
<li>If it is a floating point number, no signature may be longer (in lines)
than that number. 
<li>If it is a function, the function will be called without any parameters,
and if it returns <code>nil</code>, there is no signature in the buffer. 
<li>If it is a string, it will be used as a regexp.  If it matches, the text
in question is not a signature.
        </ol>

   <p>This variable can also be a list where the elements may be of the types
listed above.  Here's an example:

<pre class="lisp">     (setq gnus-signature-limit
           '(200.0 "^---*Forwarded article"))
</pre>
   <p>This means that if there are more than 200 lines after the signature
separator, or the text after the signature separator is matched by
the regular expression &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^---*Forwarded article</span></samp>&rsquo;, then it isn't a
signature after all.
