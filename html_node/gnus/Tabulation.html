<h4 class="subsection">9.4.7 Tabulation</h4>

<p>You can usually line up your displays by padding and cutting your
strings.  However, when combining various strings of different size, it
can often be more convenient to just output the strings, and then worry
about lining up the following text afterwards.

   <p>To do that, Gnus supplies tabulator specs&mdash;&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%=</span></samp>&rsquo;.  There are two
different types&mdash;<dfn>hard tabulators</dfn> and <dfn>soft tabulators</dfn>.

   <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%50=</span></samp>&rsquo; will insert space characters to pad the line up to column
50.  If the text is already past column 50, nothing will be inserted. 
This is the soft tabulator.

   <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%-50=</span></samp>&rsquo; will insert space characters to pad the line up to column
50.  If the text is already past column 50, the excess text past column
50 will be removed.  This is the hard tabulator.
