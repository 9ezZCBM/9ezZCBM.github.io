<h4 class="subsection">7.15.1 Advanced Scoring Syntax</h4>

<p>Ordinary scoring rules have a string as the first element in the rule. 
Advanced scoring rules have a list as the first element.  The second
element is the score to be applied if the first element evaluated to a
non-<code>nil</code> value.

   <p>These lists may consist of three logical operators, one redirection
operator, and various match operators.

   <p>Logical operators:

     <dl>
<dt><code>&amp;</code><dt><code>and</code><dd>This logical operator will evaluate each of its arguments until it finds
one that evaluates to <code>false</code>, and then it'll stop.  If all arguments
evaluate to <code>true</code> values, then this operator will return
<code>true</code>.

     <br><dt><code>|</code><dt><code>or</code><dd>This logical operator will evaluate each of its arguments until it finds
one that evaluates to <code>true</code>.  If no arguments are <code>true</code>,
then this operator will return <code>false</code>.

     <br><dt><code>!</code><dt><code>not</code><dt><code>Â¬</code><dd>This logical operator only takes a single argument.  It returns the
logical negation of the value of its argument.

   </dl>

   <p>There is an <dfn>indirection operator</dfn> that will make its arguments
apply to the ancestors of the current article being scored.  For
instance, <code>1-</code> will make score rules apply to the parent of the
current article.  <code>2-</code> will make score rules apply to the
grandparent of the current article.  Alternatively, you can write
<code>^^</code>, where the number of <code>^</code>s (carets) says how far back into
the ancestry you want to go.

   <p>Finally, we have the match operators.  These are the ones that do the
real work.  Match operators are header name strings followed by a match
and a match type.  A typical match operator looks like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">("from"
"Lars Ingebrigtsen" s)</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The header names are the same as when using
simple scoring, and the match types are also the same.
