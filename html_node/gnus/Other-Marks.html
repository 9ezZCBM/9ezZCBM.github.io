<h4 class="subsection">3.7.3 Other Marks</h4>

<p><a name="index-process-mark-778"></a><a name="index-bookmarks-779"></a>
There are some marks that have nothing to do with whether the article is
read or not.

     <ul>
<li>You can set a bookmark in the current article.  Say you are reading a
long thesis on cats' urinary tracts, and have to go home for dinner
before you've finished reading the thesis.  You can then set a bookmark
in the article, and Gnus will jump to this bookmark the next time it
encounters the article.  See <a href="Setting-Marks.html#Setting-Marks">Setting Marks</a>.

     <li><a name="index-gnus_002dreplied_002dmark-780"></a>All articles that you have replied to or made a followup to (i.e., have
answered) will be marked with an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>&rsquo; in the second column
(<code>gnus-replied-mark</code>).

     <li><a name="index-gnus_002dforwarded_002dmark-781"></a>All articles that you have forwarded will be marked with an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>&rsquo; in
the second column (<code>gnus-forwarded-mark</code>).

     <li><a name="index-gnus_002dcached_002dmark-782"></a>Articles stored in the article cache will be marked with an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; in
the second column (<code>gnus-cached-mark</code>).  See <a href="Article-Caching.html#Article-Caching">Article Caching</a>.

     <li><a name="index-gnus_002dsaved_002dmark-783"></a>Articles &ldquo;saved&rdquo; (in some manner or other; not necessarily
religiously) are marked with an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">S</span></samp>&rsquo; in the second column
(<code>gnus-saved-mark</code>).

     <li><a name="index-gnus_002dunseen_002dmark-784"></a>Articles that haven't been seen before in Gnus by the user are marked
with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; in the second column (<code>gnus-unseen-mark</code>).

     <li><a name="index-gnus_002ddownloaded_002dmark-785"></a>When using the Gnus agent (see <a href="Agent-Basics.html#Agent-Basics">Agent Basics</a>), articles may be
downloaded for unplugged (offline) viewing.  If you are using the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%O</span></samp>&rsquo; spec, these articles get the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; mark in that spec. 
(The variable <code>gnus-downloaded-mark</code> controls which character to
use.)

     <li><a name="index-gnus_002dundownloaded_002dmark-786"></a>When using the Gnus agent (see <a href="Agent-Basics.html#Agent-Basics">Agent Basics</a>), some articles might
not have been downloaded.  Such articles cannot be viewed while you
are unplugged (offline).  If you are using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%O</span></samp>&rsquo; spec, these
articles get the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; mark in that spec.  (The variable
<code>gnus-undownloaded-mark</code> controls which character to use.)

     <li><a name="index-gnus_002ddownloadable_002dmark-787"></a>The Gnus agent (see <a href="Agent-Basics.html#Agent-Basics">Agent Basics</a>) downloads some articles
automatically, but it is also possible to explicitly mark articles for
download, even if they would not be downloaded automatically.  Such
explicitly-marked articles get the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; mark in the first column. 
(The variable <code>gnus-downloadable-mark</code> controls which character to
use.)

     <li><a name="index-gnus_002dnot_002dempty_002dthread_002dmark-788"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dempty_002dthread_002dmark-789"></a>If the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%e</span></samp>&rsquo; spec is used, the presence of threads or not will be
marked with <code>gnus-not-empty-thread-mark</code> and
<code>gnus-empty-thread-mark</code> in the third column, respectively.

     <li><a name="index-gnus_002dprocess_002dmark-790"></a>Finally we have the <dfn>process mark</dfn> (<code>gnus-process-mark</code>).  A
variety of commands react to the presence of the process mark.  For
instance, <kbd>X u</kbd> (<code>gnus-uu-decode-uu</code>) will uudecode and view
all articles that have been marked with the process mark.  Articles
marked with the process mark have a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; in the second column.

   </ul>

   <p>You might have noticed that most of these &ldquo;non-readedness&rdquo; marks
appear in the second column by default.  So if you have a cached, saved,
replied article that you have process-marked, what will that look like?

   <p>Nothing much.  The precedence rules go as follows: process -&gt; cache -&gt;
replied -&gt; saved.  So if the article is in the cache and is replied,
you'll only see the cache mark and not the replied mark.
