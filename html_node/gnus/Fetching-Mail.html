<h5 class="subsubsection">6.4.4.4 Fetching Mail</h5>

<p><a name="index-mail_002dsources-2097"></a>The way to actually tell Gnus where to get new mail from is to set
<code>mail-sources</code> to a list of mail source specifiers
(see <a href="Mail-Source-Specifiers.html#Mail-Source-Specifiers">Mail Source Specifiers</a>).

   <p>If this variable is <code>nil</code>, the mail back ends will never attempt to
fetch mail by themselves.

   <p>If you want to fetch mail both from your local spool as well as a
<acronym>POP</acronym> mail server, you'd say something like:

<pre class="lisp">     (setq mail-sources
           '((file)
             (pop :server "pop3.mail.server"
                  :password "secret")))
</pre>
   <p>Or, if you don't want to use any of the keyword defaults:

<pre class="lisp">     (setq mail-sources
           '((file :path "/var/spool/mail/user-name")
             (pop :server "pop3.mail.server"
                  :user "user-name"
                  :port "pop3"
                  :password "secret")))
</pre>
   <p>When you use a mail back end, Gnus will slurp all your mail from your
inbox and plonk it down in your home directory.  Gnus doesn't move any
mail if you're not using a mail back end&mdash;you have to do a lot of magic
invocations first.  At the time when you have finished drawing the
pentagram, lightened the candles, and sacrificed the goat, you really
shouldn't be too surprised when Gnus moves your mail.
