<p><a name="index-kill-files-2516"></a><a name="index-converting-kill-files-2517"></a>
If you have loads of old kill files, you may want to convert them into
score files.  If they are &ldquo;regular&rdquo;, you can use
the <samp><span class="file">gnus-kill-to-score.el</span></samp> package; if not, you'll have to do it
by hand.

   <p>The kill to score conversion package isn't included in Emacs by default. 
You can fetch it from the contrib directory of the Gnus distribution or
from
<a href="http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~larsi/ding-various/gnus-kill-to-score.el">http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~larsi/ding-various/gnus-kill-to-score.el</a>.

   <p>If your old kill files are very complex&mdash;if they contain more
non-<code>gnus-kill</code> forms than not, you'll have to convert them by
hand.  Or just let them be as they are.  Gnus will still use them as
before.
