<h3 class="section">3.30 Duplicate Suppression</h3>

<p>By default, Gnus tries to make sure that you don't have to read the same
article more than once by utilizing the crossposting mechanism
(see <a href="Crosspost-Handling.html#Crosspost-Handling">Crosspost Handling</a>).  However, that simple and efficient
approach may not work satisfactory for some users for various
reasons.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server may fail to generate the <code>Xref</code> header.  This
is evil and not very common.

     <li>The <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server may fail to include the <code>Xref</code> header in the
<samp><span class="file">.overview</span></samp> data bases.  This is evil and all too common, alas.

     <li>You may be reading the same group (or several related groups) from
different <acronym>NNTP</acronym> servers.

     <li>You may be getting mail that duplicates articles posted to groups.
        </ol>

   <p>I'm sure there are other situations where <code>Xref</code> handling fails as
well, but these four are the most common situations.

   <p>If, and only if, <code>Xref</code> handling fails for you, then you may
consider switching on <dfn>duplicate suppression</dfn>.  If you do so, Gnus
will remember the <code>Message-ID</code>s of all articles you have read or
otherwise marked as read, and then, as if by magic, mark them as read
all subsequent times you see them&mdash;in <em>all</em> groups.  Using this
mechanism is quite likely to be somewhat inefficient, but not overly
so.  It's certainly preferable to reading the same articles more than
once.

   <p>Duplicate suppression is not a very subtle instrument.  It's more like a
sledge hammer than anything else.  It works in a very simple
fashion&mdash;if you have marked an article as read, it adds this Message-ID
to a cache.  The next time it sees this Message-ID, it will mark the
article as read with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M</span></samp>&rsquo; mark.  It doesn't care what group it
saw the article in.

     <dl>
<dt><code>gnus-suppress-duplicates</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dsuppress_002dduplicates-1715"></a>If non-<code>nil</code>, suppress duplicates.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-save-duplicate-list</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dsave_002dduplicate_002dlist-1716"></a>If non-<code>nil</code>, save the list of duplicates to a file.  This will
make startup and shutdown take longer, so the default is <code>nil</code>. 
However, this means that only duplicate articles read in a single Gnus
session are suppressed.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-duplicate-list-length</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dduplicate_002dlist_002dlength-1717"></a>This variable says how many <code>Message-ID</code>s to keep in the duplicate
suppression list.  The default is 10000.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-duplicate-file</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dduplicate_002dfile-1718"></a>The name of the file to store the duplicate suppression list in.  The
default is <samp><span class="file">~/News/suppression</span></samp>. 
</dl>

   <p>If you have a tendency to stop and start Gnus often, setting
<code>gnus-save-duplicate-list</code> to <code>t</code> is probably a good idea.  If
you leave Gnus running for weeks on end, you may have it <code>nil</code>.  On
the other hand, saving the list makes startup and shutdown much slower,
so that means that if you stop and start Gnus often, you should set
<code>gnus-save-duplicate-list</code> to <code>nil</code>.  Uhm.  I'll leave this up
to you to figure out, I think.
