<h4 class="subsection">6.4.10 Washing Mail</h4>

<p><a name="index-mail-washing-2145"></a><a name="index-list-server-brain-damage-2146"></a><a name="index-incoming-mail-treatment-2147"></a>
Mailers and list servers are notorious for doing all sorts of really,
really stupid things with mail.  &ldquo;Hey, RFC 822 doesn't explicitly
prohibit us from adding the string <code>wE aRe ElItE!!!!!1!!</code> to the
end of all lines passing through our server, so let's do that!!!!1!&rdquo;
Yes, but RFC 822 and its successors weren't designed to be read by
morons.  Things that were considered to be self-evident were not
discussed.  So.  Here we are.

   <p>Case in point:  The German version of Microsoft Exchange adds &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">AW:
</span></samp>&rsquo; to the subjects of replies instead of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Re: </span></samp>&rsquo;.  I could pretend to
be shocked and dismayed by this, but I haven't got the energy.  It is to
laugh.

   <p>Gnus provides a plethora of functions for washing articles while
displaying them, but it might be nicer to do the filtering before
storing the mail to disk.  For that purpose, we have three hooks and
various functions that can be put in these hooks.

     <dl>
<dt><code>nnmail-prepare-incoming-hook</code><dd><a name="index-nnmail_002dprepare_002dincoming_002dhook-2148"></a>This hook is called before doing anything with the mail and is meant for
grand, sweeping gestures.  It is called in a buffer that contains all
the new, incoming mail.  Functions to be used include:

          <dl>
<dt><code>nnheader-ms-strip-cr</code><dd><a name="index-nnheader_002dms_002dstrip_002dcr-2149"></a>Remove trailing carriage returns from each line.  This is default on
Emacs running on MS machines.

     </dl>

     <br><dt><code>nnmail-prepare-incoming-header-hook</code><dd><a name="index-nnmail_002dprepare_002dincoming_002dheader_002dhook-2150"></a>This hook is called narrowed to each header.  It can be used when
cleaning up the headers.  Functions that can be used include:

          <dl>
<dt><code>nnmail-remove-leading-whitespace</code><dd><a name="index-nnmail_002dremove_002dleading_002dwhitespace-2151"></a>Clear leading white space that &ldquo;helpful&rdquo; listservs have added to the
headers to make them look nice.  Aaah.

          <p>(Note that this function works on both the header on the body of all
messages, so it is a potentially dangerous function to use (if a body
of a message contains something that looks like a header line).  So
rather than fix the bug, it is of course the right solution to make it
into a feature by documenting it.)

          <br><dt><code>nnmail-remove-list-identifiers</code><dd><a name="index-nnmail_002dremove_002dlist_002didentifiers-2152"></a>Some list servers add an identifier&mdash;for example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(idm)</span></samp>&rsquo;&mdash;to the
beginning of all <code>Subject</code> headers.  I'm sure that's nice for
people who use stone age mail readers.  This function will remove
strings that match the <code>nnmail-list-identifiers</code> regexp, which can
also be a list of regexp.  <code>nnmail-list-identifiers</code> may not contain
<code>\\(..\\)</code>.

          <p>For instance, if you want to remove the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(idm)</span></samp>&rsquo; and the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nagnagnag</span></samp>&rsquo; identifiers:

          <pre class="lisp">               (setq nnmail-list-identifiers
                     '("(idm)" "nagnagnag"))
</pre>
          <p>This can also be done non-destructively with
<code>gnus-list-identifiers</code>, See <a href="Article-Hiding.html#Article-Hiding">Article Hiding</a>.

          <br><dt><code>nnmail-remove-tabs</code><dd><a name="index-nnmail_002dremove_002dtabs-2153"></a>Translate all &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;TAB&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; characters into &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;SPC&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; characters.

          <br><dt><code>nnmail-ignore-broken-references</code><dd><a name="index-nnmail_002dignore_002dbroken_002dreferences-2154"></a><!-- @findex nnmail-fix-eudora-headers -->
<a name="index-Eudora-2155"></a><a name="index-Pegasus-2156"></a>Some mail user agents (e.g., Eudora and Pegasus) produce broken
<code>References</code> headers, but correct <code>In-Reply-To</code> headers.  This
function will get rid of the <code>References</code> header if the headers
contain a line matching the regular expression
<code>nnmail-broken-references-mailers</code>.

     </dl>

     <br><dt><code>nnmail-prepare-incoming-message-hook</code><dd><a name="index-nnmail_002dprepare_002dincoming_002dmessage_002dhook-2157"></a>This hook is called narrowed to each message.  Functions to be used
include:

          <dl>
<dt><code>article-de-quoted-unreadable</code><dd><a name="index-article_002dde_002dquoted_002dunreadable-2158"></a>Decode Quoted Readable encoding.

     </dl>
     </dl>
