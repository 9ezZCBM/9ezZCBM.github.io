<h3 class="section">9.15 Fuzzy Matching</h3>

<p><a name="index-fuzzy-matching-2687"></a>
Gnus provides <dfn>fuzzy matching</dfn> of <code>Subject</code> lines when doing
things like scoring, thread gathering and thread comparison.

   <p>As opposed to regular expression matching, fuzzy matching is very fuzzy. 
It's so fuzzy that there's not even a definition of what <dfn>fuzziness</dfn>
means, and the implementation has changed over time.

   <p>Basically, it tries to remove all noise from lines before comparing. 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Re: </span></samp>&rsquo;, parenthetical remarks, white space, and so on, are filtered
out of the strings before comparing the results.  This often leads to
adequate results&mdash;even when faced with strings generated by text
manglers masquerading as newsreaders.
