<h3 class="section">6.1 Server Buffer</h3>

<p>Traditionally, a <dfn>server</dfn> is a machine or a piece of software that
one connects to, and then requests information from.  Gnus does not
connect directly to any real servers, but does all transactions through
one back end or other.  But that's just putting one layer more between
the actual media and Gnus, so we might just as well say that each
back end represents a virtual server.

   <p>For instance, the <code>nntp</code> back end may be used to connect to several
different actual <acronym>NNTP</acronym> servers, or, perhaps, to many different ports
on the same actual <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server.  You tell Gnus which back end to
use, and what parameters to set by specifying a <dfn>select method</dfn>.

   <p>These select method specifications can sometimes become quite
complicated&mdash;say, for instance, that you want to read from the
<acronym>NNTP</acronym> server &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">news.funet.fi</span></samp>&rsquo; on port number 13, which
hangs if queried for <acronym>NOV</acronym> headers and has a buggy select.  Ahem. 
Anyway, if you had to specify that for each group that used this
server, that would be too much work, so Gnus offers a way of naming
select methods, which is what you do in the server buffer.

   <p>To enter the server buffer, use the <kbd>^</kbd>
(<code>gnus-group-enter-server-mode</code>) command in the group buffer.

<ul class="menu">
<li><a accesskey="1" href="Server-Buffer-Format.html#Server-Buffer-Format">Server Buffer Format</a>:         You can customize the look of this buffer. 
<li><a accesskey="2" href="Server-Commands.html#Server-Commands">Server Commands</a>:              Commands to manipulate servers. 
<li><a accesskey="3" href="Example-Methods.html#Example-Methods">Example Methods</a>:              Examples server specifications. 
<li><a accesskey="4" href="Creating-a-Virtual-Server.html#Creating-a-Virtual-Server">Creating a Virtual Server</a>:    An example session. 
<li><a accesskey="5" href="Server-Variables.html#Server-Variables">Server Variables</a>:             Which variables to set. 
<li><a accesskey="6" href="Servers-and-Methods.html#Servers-and-Methods">Servers and Methods</a>:          You can use server names as select methods. 
<li><a accesskey="7" href="Unavailable-Servers.html#Unavailable-Servers">Unavailable Servers</a>:          Some servers you try to contact may be down. 
</ul>
