<h4 class="subsection">11.7.8 Emacs/XEmacs Code</h4>

<p><a name="index-XEmacs-3063"></a><a name="index-Emacsen-3064"></a>
While Gnus runs under Emacs, XEmacs and Mule, I decided that one of the
platforms must be the primary one.  I chose Emacs.  Not because I don't
like XEmacs or Mule, but because it comes first alphabetically.

   <p>This means that Gnus will byte-compile under Emacs with nary a warning,
while XEmacs will pump out gigabytes of warnings while byte-compiling. 
As I use byte-compilation warnings to help me root out trivial errors in
Gnus, that's very useful.

   <p>I've also consistently used Emacs function interfaces, but have used
Gnusey aliases for the functions.  To take an example:  Emacs defines a
<code>run-at-time</code> function while XEmacs defines a <code>start-itimer</code>
function.  I then define a function called <code>gnus-run-at-time</code> that
takes the same parameters as the Emacs <code>run-at-time</code>.  When running
Gnus under Emacs, the former function is just an alias for the latter. 
However, when running under XEmacs, the former is an alias for the
following function:

<pre class="lisp">     (defun gnus-xmas-run-at-time (time repeat function &amp;rest args)
       (start-itimer
        "gnus-run-at-time"
        `(lambda ()
           (,function ,@args))
        time repeat))
</pre>
   <p>This sort of thing has been done for bunches of functions.  Gnus does
not redefine any native Emacs functions while running under XEmacs&mdash;it
does this <code>defalias</code> thing with Gnus equivalents instead.  Cleaner
all over.

   <p>In the cases where the XEmacs function interface was obviously cleaner,
I used it instead.  For example <code>gnus-region-active-p</code> is an alias
for <code>region-active-p</code> in XEmacs, whereas in Emacs it is a function.

   <p>Of course, I could have chosen XEmacs as my native platform and done
mapping functions the other way around.  But I didn't.  The performance
hit these indirections impose on Gnus under XEmacs should be slight.
