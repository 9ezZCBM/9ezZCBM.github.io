The first &ldquo;proper&rdquo; release of Gnus 5 was done in November 1995 when it
was included in the Emacs 19.30 distribution (132 (ding) Gnus releases

   <p>In May 1996 the next Gnus generation (aka. &ldquo;September Gnus&rdquo; (after 99
releases)) was released under the name &ldquo;Gnus 5.2&rdquo; (40 releases).

   <p>On July 28th 1996 work on Red Gnus was begun, and it was released on
January 25th 1997 (after 84 releases) as &ldquo;Gnus 5.4&rdquo; (67 releases).

   <p>If you happen upon a version of Gnus that has a prefixed name&mdash;&ldquo;(ding)
Gnus&rdquo;, &ldquo;September Gnus&rdquo;, &ldquo;Red Gnus&rdquo;, &ldquo;Quassia Gnus&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Pterodactyl Gnus&rdquo;, &ldquo;Oort Gnus&rdquo;, &ldquo;No Gnus&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ma Gnus&rdquo;&mdash;don't
panic.  Don't let it know that you're frightened.  Back away.  Slowly. 
Whatever you do, don't run.  Walk away, calmly, until you're out of
its reach.  Find a proper released version of Gnus and snuggle up to
that instead.
