<h4 class="subsection">6.6.1 Directory Groups</h4>

<p><a name="index-nndir-2242"></a><a name="index-directory-groups-2243"></a>
If you have a directory that has lots of articles in separate files in
it, you might treat it as a newsgroup.  The files have to have numerical
names, of course.

   <p>This might be an opportune moment to mention <code>ange-ftp</code> (and its
successor <code>efs</code>), that most wonderful of all wonderful Emacs
packages.  When I wrote <code>nndir</code>, I didn't think much about it&mdash;a
back end to read directories.  Big deal.

   <p><code>ange-ftp</code> changes that picture dramatically.  For instance, if you
enter the <code>ange-ftp</code> file name
<samp><span class="file">/ftp.hpc.uh.edu:/pub/emacs/ding-list/</span></samp> as the directory name,
<code>ange-ftp</code> or <code>efs</code> will actually allow you to read this
directory over at &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sina</span></samp>&rsquo; as a newsgroup.  Distributed news ahoy!

   <p><code>nndir</code> will use <acronym>NOV</acronym> files if they are present.

   <p><code>nndir</code> is a &ldquo;read-only&rdquo; back end&mdash;you can't delete or expire
articles with this method.  You can use <code>nnmh</code> or <code>nnml</code> for
whatever you use <code>nndir</code> for, so you could switch to any of those
methods if you feel the need to have a non-read-only <code>nndir</code>.
