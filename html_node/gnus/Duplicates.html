<h4 class="subsection">6.4.11 Duplicates</h4>

<p><a name="index-nnmail_002dtreat_002dduplicates-2159"></a><a name="index-nnmail_002dmessage_002did_002dcache_002dlength-2160"></a><a name="index-nnmail_002dmessage_002did_002dcache_002dfile-2161"></a><a name="index-duplicate-mails-2162"></a>If you are a member of a couple of mailing lists, you will sometimes
receive two copies of the same mail.  This can be quite annoying, so
<code>nnmail</code> checks for and treats any duplicates it might find.  To do
this, it keeps a cache of old <code>Message-ID</code>s:
<code>nnmail-message-id-cache-file</code>, which is <samp><span class="file">~/.nnmail-cache</span></samp> by
default.  The approximate maximum number of <code>Message-ID</code>s stored
there is controlled by the <code>nnmail-message-id-cache-length</code>
variable, which is 1000 by default.  (So 1000 <code>Message-ID</code>s will be
stored.)  If all this sounds scary to you, you can set
<code>nnmail-treat-duplicates</code> to <code>warn</code> (which is what it is by
default), and <code>nnmail</code> won't delete duplicate mails.  Instead it
will insert a warning into the head of the mail saying that it thinks
that this is a duplicate of a different message.

   <p>This variable can also be a function.  If that's the case, the function
will be called from a buffer narrowed to the message in question with
the <code>Message-ID</code> as a parameter.  The function must return either
<code>nil</code>, <code>warn</code>, or <code>delete</code>.

   <p>You can turn this feature off completely by setting the variable to
<code>nil</code>.

   <p>If you want all the duplicate mails to be put into a special
<dfn>duplicates</dfn> group, you could do that using the normal mail split
methods:

<pre class="lisp">     (setq nnmail-split-fancy
           '(| ;; <span class="roman">Messages duplicates go to a separate group.</span>
             ("gnus-warning" "duplicat\\(e\\|ion\\) of message" "duplicate")
             ;; <span class="roman">Message from daemons, postmaster, and the like to another.</span>
             (any mail "mail.misc")
             ;; <span class="roman">Other rules.</span>
             [...] ))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Or something like:
<pre class="lisp">     (setq nnmail-split-methods
           '(("duplicates" "^Gnus-Warning:.*duplicate")
             ;; <span class="roman">Other rules.</span>
             [...]))
</pre>
   <p>Here's a neat feature: If you know that the recipient reads her mail
with Gnus, and that she has <code>nnmail-treat-duplicates</code> set to
<code>delete</code>, you can send her as many insults as you like, just by
using a <code>Message-ID</code> of a mail that you know that she's already
received.  Think of all the fun!  She'll never see any of it!  Whee!
