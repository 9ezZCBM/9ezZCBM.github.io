<h4 class="subsection">6.8.3 Sending or Not Sending</h4>

<p>Well, assuming you've read all of the above, here are two final notes on
mail sending with <code>nndiary</code>:

     <ul>
<li><code>nndiary</code> is a <em>real</em> mail back end.  You really send real diary
messages for real.  This means for instance that you can give
appointments to anybody (provided they use Gnus and <code>nndiary</code>) by
sending the diary message to them as well. 
<li>However, since <code>nndiary</code> also has a <code>request-post</code> method, you
can also use <kbd>C-u a</kbd> instead of <kbd>C-u m</kbd> on a diary group and the
message won't actually be sent; just stored locally in the group.  This
comes in very handy for private appointments. 
</ul>
