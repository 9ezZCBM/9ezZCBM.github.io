<h3 class="section">9.3 Symbolic Prefixes</h3>

<p><a name="index-symbolic-prefixes-2583"></a>
Quite a lot of Emacs commands react to the (numeric) prefix.  For
instance, <kbd>C-u 4 C-f</kbd> moves point four characters forward, and
<kbd>C-u 9 0 0 I s s p</kbd> adds a permanent <code>Subject</code> substring score
rule of 900 to the current article.

   <p>This is all nice and well, but what if you want to give a command some
additional information?  Well, what most commands do is interpret the
&ldquo;raw&rdquo; prefix in some special way.  <kbd>C-u 0 C-x C-s</kbd> means that one
doesn't want a backup file to be created when saving the current buffer,
for instance.  But what if you want to save without making a backup
file, and you want Emacs to flash lights and play a nice tune at the
same time?  You can't, and you're probably perfectly happy that way.

   <p><a name="index-M_002di-_0040r_007b_0028Summary_0029_007d-2584"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dsymbolic_002dargument-2585"></a>I'm not, so I've added a second prefix&mdash;the <dfn>symbolic prefix</dfn>.  The
prefix key is <kbd>M-i</kbd> (<code>gnus-symbolic-argument</code>), and the next
character typed in is the value.  You can stack as many <kbd>M-i</kbd>
prefixes as you want.  <kbd>M-i a C-M-u</kbd> means &ldquo;feed the <kbd>C-M-u</kbd>
command the symbolic prefix <code>a</code>&rdquo;.  <kbd>M-i a M-i b C-M-u</kbd> means
&ldquo;feed the <kbd>C-M-u</kbd> command the symbolic prefixes <code>a</code> and
<code>b</code>&rdquo;.  You get the drift.

   <p>Typing in symbolic prefixes to commands that don't accept them doesn't
hurt, but it doesn't do any good either.  Currently not many Gnus
functions make use of the symbolic prefix.

   <p>If you're interested in how Gnus implements this, see <a href="Extended-Interactive.html#Extended-Interactive">Extended Interactive</a>.
