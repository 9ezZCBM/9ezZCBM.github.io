<h4 class="subsection">11.7.4 Headers</h4>

<p>Internally Gnus uses a format for storing article headers that
corresponds to the <acronym>NOV</acronym> format in a mysterious fashion.  One could
almost suspect that the author looked at the <acronym>NOV</acronym> specification and
just shamelessly <em>stole</em> the entire thing, and one would be right.

   <p><dfn>Header</dfn> is a severely overloaded term.  &ldquo;Header&rdquo; is used in
RFC 5536 to talk about lines in the head of an article (e.g.,
<code>From</code>).  It is used by many people as a synonym for
&ldquo;head&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the header and the body&rdquo;.  (That should be avoided, in my
opinion.)  And Gnus uses a format internally that it calls &ldquo;header&rdquo;,
which is what I'm talking about here.  This is a 9-element vector,
basically, with each header (ouch) having one slot.

   <p>These slots are, in order: <code>number</code>, <code>subject</code>, <code>from</code>,
<code>date</code>, <code>id</code>, <code>references</code>, <code>chars</code>, <code>lines</code>,
<code>xref</code>, and <code>extra</code>.  There are macros for accessing and
setting these slots&mdash;they all have predictable names beginning with
<code>mail-header-</code> and <code>mail-header-set-</code>, respectively.

   <p>All these slots contain strings, except the <code>extra</code> slot, which
contains an alist of header/value pairs (see <a href="To-From-Newsgroups.html#To-From-Newsgroups">To From Newsgroups</a>).
