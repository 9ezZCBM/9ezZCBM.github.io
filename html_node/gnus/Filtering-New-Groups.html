<h4 class="subsection">1.4.3 Filtering New Groups</h4>

<p>A nice and portable way to control which new newsgroups should be
subscribed (or ignored) is to put an <dfn>options</dfn> line at the start of
the <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> file.  Here's an example:

<pre class="example">     options -n !alt.all !rec.all sci.all
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dsubscribe_002doptions_002dnewsgroup_002dmethod-28"></a>This line obviously belongs to a serious-minded intellectual scientific
person (or she may just be plain old boring), because it says that all
groups that have names beginning with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">alt</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rec</span></samp>&rsquo; should
be ignored, and all groups with names beginning with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sci</span></samp>&rsquo; should
be subscribed.  Gnus will not use the normal subscription method for
subscribing these groups. 
<code>gnus-subscribe-options-newsgroup-method</code> is used instead.  This
variable defaults to <code>gnus-subscribe-alphabetically</code>.

   <p>The &ldquo;options -n&rdquo; format is very simplistic.  The syntax above is all
that is supports: you can force-subscribe hierarchies, or you can
deny hierarchies, and that's it.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002doptions_002dnot_002dsubscribe-29"></a><a name="index-gnus_002doptions_002dsubscribe-30"></a>If you don't want to mess with your <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> file, you can just
set the two variables <code>gnus-options-subscribe</code> and
<code>gnus-options-not-subscribe</code>.  These two variables do exactly the
same as the <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">options -n</span></samp>&rsquo; trick.  Both are regexps,
and if the new group matches the former, it will be unconditionally
subscribed, and if it matches the latter, it will be ignored.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dauto_002dsubscribed_002dgroups-31"></a>Yet another variable that meddles here is
<code>gnus-auto-subscribed-groups</code>.  It works exactly like
<code>gnus-options-subscribe</code>, and is therefore really superfluous,
but I thought it would be nice to have two of these.  This variable is
more meant for setting some ground rules, while the other variable is
used more for user fiddling.  By default this variable makes all new
groups that come from mail back ends (<code>nnml</code>, <code>nnbabyl</code>,
<code>nnfolder</code>, <code>nnmbox</code>, <code>nnmh</code>, <code>nnimap</code>, and
<code>nnmaildir</code>) subscribed.  If you don't like that, just set this
variable to <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dauto_002dsubscribed_002dcategories-32"></a>As if that wasn't enough, <code>gnus-auto-subscribed-categories</code> also
allows you to specify that new groups should be subscribed based on the
category their select methods belong to.  The default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(mail
post-mail)</span></samp>&rsquo;, meaning that all new groups from mail-like backends
should be subscribed automatically.

   <p>New groups that match these variables are subscribed using
<code>gnus-subscribe-options-newsgroup-method</code>.
