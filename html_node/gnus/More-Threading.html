<h5 class="subsubsection">3.9.1.3 More Threading</h5>

     <dl>
<dt><code>gnus-show-threads</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dshow_002dthreads-963"></a>If this variable is <code>nil</code>, no threading will be done, and all of
the rest of the variables here will have no effect.  Turning threading
off will speed group selection up a bit, but it is sure to make reading
slower and more awkward.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-thread-hide-subtree</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dthread_002dhide_002dsubtree-964"></a>If non-<code>nil</code>, all threads will be hidden when the summary buffer is
generated.

     <p>This can also be a predicate specifier (see <a href="Predicate-Specifiers.html#Predicate-Specifiers">Predicate Specifiers</a>). 
Available predicates are <code>gnus-article-unread-p</code> and
<code>gnus-article-unseen-p</code>.

     <p>Here's an example:

     <pre class="lisp">          (setq gnus-thread-hide-subtree
                '(or gnus-article-unread-p
                     gnus-article-unseen-p))
</pre>
     <p>(It's a pretty nonsensical example, since all unseen articles are also
unread, but you get my drift.)

     <br><dt><code>gnus-thread-expunge-below</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dthread_002dexpunge_002dbelow-965"></a>All threads that have a total score (as defined by
<code>gnus-thread-score-function</code>) less than this number will be
expunged.  This variable is <code>nil</code> by default, which means that no
threads are expunged.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-thread-hide-killed</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dthread_002dhide_002dkilled-966"></a>if you kill a thread and this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, the subtree
will be hidden.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-thread-ignore-subject</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dthread_002dignore_002dsubject-967"></a>Sometimes somebody changes the subject in the middle of a thread.  If
this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, which is the default, the subject
change is ignored.  If it is <code>nil</code>, a change in the subject will
result in a new thread.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-thread-indent-level</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dthread_002dindent_002dlevel-968"></a>This is a number that says how much each sub-thread should be indented. 
The default is 4.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-sort-gathered-threads-function</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dsort_002dgathered_002dthreads_002dfunction-969"></a>Sometimes, particularly with mailing lists, the order in which mails
arrive locally is not necessarily the same as the order in which they
arrived on the mailing list.  Consequently, when sorting sub-threads
using the default <code>gnus-thread-sort-by-number</code>, responses can end
up appearing before the article to which they are responding to. 
Setting this variable to an alternate value
(e.g., <code>gnus-thread-sort-by-date</code>), in a group's parameters or in an
appropriate hook (e.g., <code>gnus-summary-generate-hook</code>) can produce a
more logical sub-thread ordering in such instances.
