<h4 class="subsection">6.5.2 Web Searches</h4>

<p><a name="index-nnweb-2221"></a><a name="index-Google-2222"></a><a name="index-dejanews-2223"></a><a name="index-gmane-2224"></a><a name="index-Usenet-searches-2225"></a><a name="index-searching-the-Usenet-2226"></a>
It's, like, too neat to search the Usenet for articles that match a
string, but it, like, totally <em>sucks</em>, like, totally, to use one of
those, like, Web browsers, and you, like, have to, rilly, like, look at
the commercials, so, like, with Gnus you can do <em>rad</em>, rilly,
searches without having to use a browser.

   <p>The <code>nnweb</code> back end allows an easy interface to the mighty search
engine.  You create an <code>nnweb</code> group, enter a search pattern, and
then enter the group and read the articles like you would any normal
group.  The <kbd>G w</kbd> command in the group buffer (see <a href="Foreign-Groups.html#Foreign-Groups">Foreign Groups</a>) will do this in an easy-to-use fashion.

   <p><code>nnweb</code> groups don't really lend themselves to being solid
groups&mdash;they have a very fleeting idea of article numbers.  In fact,
each time you enter an <code>nnweb</code> group (not even changing the search
pattern), you are likely to get the articles ordered in a different
manner.  Not even using duplicate suppression (see <a href="Duplicate-Suppression.html#Duplicate-Suppression">Duplicate Suppression</a>) will help, since <code>nnweb</code> doesn't even know the
<code>Message-ID</code> of the articles before reading them using some search
engines (Google, for instance).  The only possible way to keep track
of which articles you've read is by scoring on the <code>Date</code>
header&mdash;mark all articles posted before the last date you read the
group as read.

   <p>If the search engine changes its output substantially, <code>nnweb</code>
won't be able to parse it and will fail.  One could hardly fault the Web
providers if they were to do this&mdash;their <em>raison d'Ãªtre</em> is to
make money off of advertisements, not to provide services to the
community.  Since <code>nnweb</code> washes the ads off all the articles, one
might think that the providers might be somewhat miffed.  We'll see.

   <p>Virtual server variables:

     <dl>
<dt><code>nnweb-type</code><dd><a name="index-nnweb_002dtype-2227"></a>What search engine type is being used.  The currently supported types
are <code>google</code>, <code>dejanews</code>, and <code>gmane</code>.  Note that
<code>dejanews</code> is an alias to <code>google</code>.

     <br><dt><code>nnweb-search</code><dd><a name="index-nnweb_002dsearch-2228"></a>The search string to feed to the search engine.

     <br><dt><code>nnweb-max-hits</code><dd><a name="index-nnweb_002dmax_002dhits-2229"></a>Advisory maximum number of hits per search to display.  The default is
999.

     <br><dt><code>nnweb-type-definition</code><dd><a name="index-nnweb_002dtype_002ddefinition-2230"></a>Type-to-definition alist.  This alist says what <code>nnweb</code> should do
with the various search engine types.  The following elements must be
present:

          <dl>
<dt><code>article</code><dd>Function to decode the article and provide something that Gnus
understands.

          <br><dt><code>map</code><dd>Function to create an article number to message header and URL alist.

          <br><dt><code>search</code><dd>Function to send the search string to the search engine.

          <br><dt><code>address</code><dd>The address the aforementioned function should send the search string
to.

          <br><dt><code>id</code><dd>Format string URL to fetch an article by <code>Message-ID</code>. 
</dl>
