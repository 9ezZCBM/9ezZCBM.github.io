<h4 class="subsection">6.4.8 Incorporating Old Mail</h4>

<p><a name="index-incorporating-old-mail-2129"></a><a name="index-import-old-mail-2130"></a>
Most people have lots of old mail stored in various file formats.  If
you have set up Gnus to read mail using one of the spiffy Gnus mail
back ends, you'll probably wish to have that old mail incorporated into
your mail groups.

   <p>Doing so can be quite easy.

   <p>To take an example: You're reading mail using <code>nnml</code>
(see <a href="Mail-Spool.html#Mail-Spool">Mail Spool</a>), and have set <code>nnmail-split-methods</code> to a
satisfactory value (see <a href="Splitting-Mail.html#Splitting-Mail">Splitting Mail</a>).  You have an old Unix mbox
file filled with important, but old, mail.  You want to move it into
your <code>nnml</code> groups.

   <p>Here's how:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Go to the group buffer.

     <li>Type <kbd>G f</kbd> and give the file name to the mbox file when prompted to create an
<code>nndoc</code> group from the mbox file (see <a href="Foreign-Groups.html#Foreign-Groups">Foreign Groups</a>).

     <li>Type <kbd>&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> to enter the newly created group.

     <li>Type <kbd>M P b</kbd> to process-mark all articles in this group's buffer
(see <a href="Setting-Process-Marks.html#Setting-Process-Marks">Setting Process Marks</a>).

     <li>Type <kbd>B r</kbd> to respool all the process-marked articles, and answer
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nnml</span></samp>&rsquo; when prompted (see <a href="Mail-Group-Commands.html#Mail-Group-Commands">Mail Group Commands</a>).
        </ol>

   <p>All the mail messages in the mbox file will now also be spread out over
all your <code>nnml</code> groups.  Try entering them and check whether things
have gone without a glitch.  If things look ok, you may consider
deleting the mbox file, but I wouldn't do that unless I was absolutely
sure that all the mail has ended up where it should be.

   <p>Respooling is also a handy thing to do if you're switching from one mail
back end to another.  Just respool all the mail in the old mail groups
using the new mail back end.
