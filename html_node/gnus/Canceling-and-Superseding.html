<h4 class="subsection">3.5.4 Canceling Articles</h4>

<p><a name="index-canceling-articles-745"></a><a name="index-superseding-articles-746"></a>
Have you ever written something, and then decided that you really,
really, really wish you hadn't posted that?

   <p>Well, you can't cancel mail, but you can cancel posts.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dsummary_002dcancel_002darticle-747"></a><a name="index-C-_0040r_007b_0028Summary_0029_007d-748"></a><!-- @icon{gnus-summary-cancel-article} -->
Find the article you wish to cancel (you can only cancel your own
articles, so don't try any funny stuff).  Then press <kbd>C</kbd> or <kbd>S
c</kbd> (<code>gnus-summary-cancel-article</code>).  Your article will be
canceled&mdash;machines all over the world will be deleting your article. 
This command uses the process/prefix convention (see <a href="Process_002fPrefix.html#Process_002fPrefix">Process/Prefix</a>).

   <p>Be aware, however, that not all sites honor cancels, so your article may
live on here and there, while most sites will delete the article in
question.

   <p>Gnus will use the &ldquo;current&rdquo; select method when canceling.  If you
want to use the standard posting method, use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; symbolic
prefix (see <a href="Symbolic-Prefixes.html#Symbolic-Prefixes">Symbolic Prefixes</a>).

   <p>Gnus ensures that only you can cancel your own messages using a
<code>Cancel-Lock</code> header (see <a href="../message/Canceling-News.html#Canceling-News">Canceling News</a>).

   <p>If you discover that you have made some mistakes and want to do some
corrections, you can post a <dfn>superseding</dfn> article that will replace
your original article.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dsummary_002dsupersede_002darticle-749"></a><a name="index-S-_0040r_007b_0028Summary_0029_007d-750"></a>Go to the original article and press <kbd>S s</kbd>
(<code>gnus-summary-supersede-article</code>).  You will be put in a buffer
where you can edit the article all you want before sending it off the
usual way.

   <p>The same goes for superseding as for canceling, only more so: Some
sites do not honor superseding.  On those sites, it will appear that you
have posted almost the same article twice.

   <p>If you have just posted the article, and change your mind right away,
there is a trick you can use to cancel/supersede the article without
waiting for the article to appear on your site first.  You simply return
to the post buffer (which is called <samp><span class="file">*sent ...*</span></samp>).  There you will
find the article you just posted, with all the headers intact.  Change
the <code>Message-ID</code> header to a <code>Cancel</code> or <code>Supersedes</code>
header by substituting one of those words for the word
<code>Message-ID</code>.  Then just press <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> to send the article as
you would do normally.  The previous article will be
canceled/superseded.

   <p>Just remember, kids: There is no 'c' in 'supersede'.
