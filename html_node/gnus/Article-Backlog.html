<p><a name="index-backlog-1074"></a><a name="index-article-backlog-1075"></a>
If you have a slow connection, but the idea of using caching seems
unappealing to you (and it is, really), you can help the situation some
by switching on the <dfn>backlog</dfn>.  This is where Gnus will buffer
already read articles so that it doesn't have to re-fetch articles
you've already read.  This only helps if you are in the habit of
re-selecting articles you've recently read, of course.  If you never do
that, turning the backlog on will slow Gnus down a little bit, and
increase memory usage some.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dkeep_002dbacklog-1076"></a>If you set <code>gnus-keep-backlog</code> to a number <var>n</var>, Gnus will store
at most <var>n</var> old articles in a buffer for later re-fetching.  If this
variable is non-<code>nil</code> and is not a number, Gnus will store
<em>all</em> read articles, which means that your Emacs will grow without
bound before exploding and taking your machine down with you.  I put
that in there just to keep y'all on your toes.

   <p>The default value is 20.
