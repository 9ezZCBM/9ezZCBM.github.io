<h3 class="section">3.2 Summary Maneuvering</h3>

<p><a name="index-summary-movement-595"></a>
All the straight movement commands understand the numeric prefix and
behave pretty much as you'd expect.

   <p>None of these commands select articles.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>G M-n</kbd><dt><kbd>M-n</kbd><dd><a name="index-M_002dn-_0040r_007b_0028Summary_0029_007d-596"></a><a name="index-G-M_002dn-_0040r_007b_0028Summary_0029_007d-597"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dsummary_002dnext_002dunread_002dsubject-598"></a>Go to the next summary line of an unread article
(<code>gnus-summary-next-unread-subject</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>G M-p</kbd><dt><kbd>M-p</kbd><dd><a name="index-M_002dp-_0040r_007b_0028Summary_0029_007d-599"></a><a name="index-G-M_002dp-_0040r_007b_0028Summary_0029_007d-600"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dsummary_002dprev_002dunread_002dsubject-601"></a>Go to the previous summary line of an unread article
(<code>gnus-summary-prev-unread-subject</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>G g</kbd><dd><a name="index-G-g-_0040r_007b_0028Summary_0029_007d-602"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dsummary_002dgoto_002dsubject-603"></a>Ask for an article number and then go to the summary line of that article
without displaying the article (<code>gnus-summary-goto-subject</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>If Gnus asks you to press a key to confirm going to the next group, you
can use the <kbd>C-n</kbd> and <kbd>C-p</kbd> keys to move around the group
buffer, searching for the next group to read without actually returning
to the group buffer.

   <p>Variables related to summary movement:

     
<a name="index-gnus_002dauto_002dselect_002dnext-604"></a>
<dl><dt><code>gnus-auto-select-next</code><dd>If you issue one of the movement commands (like <kbd>n</kbd>) and there are
no more unread articles after the current one, Gnus will offer to go to
the next group.  If this variable is <code>t</code> and the next group is
empty, Gnus will exit summary mode and return to the group buffer.  If
this variable is neither <code>t</code> nor <code>nil</code>, Gnus will select the
next group with unread articles.  As a special case, if this variable
is <code>quietly</code>, Gnus will select the next group without asking for
confirmation.  If this variable is <code>almost-quietly</code>, the same
will happen only if you are located on the last article in the group. 
Finally, if this variable is <code>slightly-quietly</code>, the <kbd>Z n</kbd>
command will go to the next group without confirmation.  Also
see <a href="Group-Levels.html#Group-Levels">Group Levels</a>.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-auto-select-same</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dauto_002dselect_002dsame-605"></a>If non-<code>nil</code>, all the movement commands will try to go to the next
article with the same subject as the current.  (<dfn>Same</dfn> here might
mean <dfn>roughly equal</dfn>.  See <code>gnus-summary-gather-subject-limit</code>
for details (see <a href="Customizing-Threading.html#Customizing-Threading">Customizing Threading</a>).)  If there are no more
articles with the same subject, go to the first unread article.

     <p>This variable is not particularly useful if you use a threaded display.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-summary-check-current</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dsummary_002dcheck_002dcurrent-606"></a>If non-<code>nil</code>, all the &ldquo;unread&rdquo; movement commands will not proceed
to the next (or previous) article if the current article is unread. 
Instead, they will choose the current article.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-auto-center-summary</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dauto_002dcenter_002dsummary-607"></a>If non-<code>nil</code>, Gnus will keep the point in the summary buffer
centered at all times.  This makes things quite tidy, but if you have a
slow network connection, or simply do not like this un-Emacsism, you can
set this variable to <code>nil</code> to get the normal Emacs scrolling
action.  This will also inhibit horizontal re-centering of the summary
buffer, which might make it more inconvenient to read extremely long
threads.

     <p>This variable can also be a number.  In that case, center the window at
the given number of lines from the top.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-summary-stop-at-end-of-message</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dsummary_002dstop_002dat_002dend_002dof_002dmessage-608"></a>If non-<code>nil</code>, don't go to the next article when hitting
<kbd>&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>, and you're at the end of the article.
