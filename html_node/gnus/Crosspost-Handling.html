<h3 class="section">3.29 Crosspost Handling</h3>

<p><a name="index-velveeta-1708"></a><a name="index-spamming-1709"></a>Marking cross-posted articles as read ensures that you'll never have to
read the same article more than once.  Unless, of course, somebody has
posted it to several groups separately.  Posting the same article to
several groups (not cross-posting) is called <dfn>spamming</dfn>, and you are
by law required to send nasty-grams to anyone who perpetrates such a
heinous crime.

   <p>Remember: Cross-posting is kinda ok, but posting the same article
separately to several groups is not.  Massive cross-posting (aka. 
<dfn>velveeta</dfn>) is to be avoided at all costs, and you can even use the
<code>gnus-summary-mail-crosspost-complaint</code> command to complain about
excessive crossposting (see <a href="Summary-Mail-Commands.html#Summary-Mail-Commands">Summary Mail Commands</a>).

   <p><a name="index-cross_002dposting-1710"></a><a name="index-Xref-1711"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040acronym_007bNOV_007d-1712"></a>One thing that may cause Gnus to not do the cross-posting thing
correctly is if you use an <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server that supports <span class="sc">xover</span>
(which is very nice, because it speeds things up considerably) which
does not include the <code>Xref</code> header in its <acronym>NOV</acronym> lines.  This is
Evil, but all too common, alas, alack.  Gnus tries to Do The Right Thing
even with <span class="sc">xover</span> by registering the <code>Xref</code> lines of all
articles you actually read, but if you kill the articles, or just mark
them as read without reading them, Gnus will not get a chance to snoop
the <code>Xref</code> lines out of these articles, and will be unable to use
the cross reference mechanism.

   <p><a name="index-LIST-overview_002efmt-1713"></a><a name="index-overview_002efmt-1714"></a>To check whether your <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server includes the <code>Xref</code> header
in its overview files, try &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">telnet your.nntp.server nntp</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">MODE READER</span></samp>&rsquo; on <code>inn</code> servers, and then say &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">LIST
overview.fmt</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This may not work, but if it does, and the last line you
get does not read &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Xref:full</span></samp>&rsquo;, then you should shout and whine at
your news admin until she includes the <code>Xref</code> header in the
overview files.

   <p>If you want Gnus to get the <code>Xref</code>s right all the time, you have to
set <code>nntp-nov-is-evil</code> to <code>t</code>, which slows things down
considerably.  Also see <a href="Slow_002fExpensive-Connection.html#Slow_002fExpensive-Connection">Slow/Expensive Connection</a>.

   <p>C'est la vie.
