<h3 class="section">1.6 Startup Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-startup-files-36"></a><a name="index-g_t_002enewsrc-37"></a><a name="index-g_t_002enewsrc_002eel-38"></a><a name="index-g_t_002enewsrc_002eeld-39"></a>
Most common Unix news readers use a shared startup file called
<samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp>.  This file contains all the information about what
groups are subscribed, and which articles in these groups have been
read.

   <p>Things got a bit more complicated with <span class="sc">gnus</span>.  In addition to
keeping the <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> file updated, it also used a file called
<samp><span class="file">.newsrc.el</span></samp> for storing all the information that didn't fit into
the <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> file.  (Actually, it also duplicated everything in
the <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> file.)  <span class="sc">gnus</span> would read whichever one of these
files was the most recently saved, which enabled people to swap between
<span class="sc">gnus</span> and other newsreaders.

   <p>That was kinda silly, so Gnus went one better: In addition to the
<samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">.newsrc.el</span></samp> files, Gnus also has a file called
<samp><span class="file">.newsrc.eld</span></samp>.  It will read whichever of these files that are most
recent, but it will never write a <samp><span class="file">.newsrc.el</span></samp> file.  You should
never delete the <samp><span class="file">.newsrc.eld</span></samp> file&mdash;it contains much information
not stored in the <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> file.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dsave_002dnewsrc_002dfile-40"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dread_002dnewsrc_002dfile-41"></a>You can turn off writing the <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> file by setting
<code>gnus-save-newsrc-file</code> to <code>nil</code>, which means you can delete
the file and save some space, as well as exiting from Gnus faster. 
However, this will make it impossible to use other newsreaders than
Gnus.  But hey, who would want to, right?  Similarly, setting
<code>gnus-read-newsrc-file</code> to <code>nil</code> makes Gnus ignore the
<samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> file and any <samp><span class="file">.newsrc-SERVER</span></samp> files, which can be
convenient if you use a different news reader occasionally, and you
want to read a different subset of the available groups with that
news reader.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dsave_002dkilled_002dlist-42"></a>If <code>gnus-save-killed-list</code> (default <code>t</code>) is <code>nil</code>, Gnus
will not save the list of killed groups to the startup file.  This will
save both time (when starting and quitting) and space (on disk).  It
will also mean that Gnus has no record of what groups are new or old,
so the automatic new groups subscription methods become meaningless. 
You should always set <code>gnus-check-new-newsgroups</code> to <code>nil</code> or
<code>ask-server</code> if you set this variable to <code>nil</code> (see <a href="New-Groups.html#New-Groups">New Groups</a>).  This variable can also be a regular expression.  If that's
the case, remove all groups that do not match this regexp before
saving.  This can be useful in certain obscure situations that involve
several servers where not all servers support <code>ask-server</code>.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dstartup_002dfile-43"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dbackup_002dstartup_002dfile-44"></a><a name="index-version_002dcontrol-45"></a>The <code>gnus-startup-file</code> variable says where the startup files are. 
The default value is <samp><span class="file">~/.newsrc</span></samp>, with the Gnus (El Dingo) startup
file being whatever that one is, with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.eld</span></samp>&rsquo; appended. 
If you want to keep multiple numbered backups of this file, set
<code>gnus-backup-startup-file</code>.  It respects the same values as the
<code>version-control</code> variable.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dsave_002dnewsrc_002dhook-46"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dsave_002dquick_002dnewsrc_002dhook-47"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dsave_002dstandard_002dnewsrc_002dhook-48"></a><code>gnus-save-newsrc-hook</code> is called before saving any of the newsrc
files, while <code>gnus-save-quick-newsrc-hook</code> is called just before
saving the <samp><span class="file">.newsrc.eld</span></samp> file, and
<code>gnus-save-standard-newsrc-hook</code> is called just before saving the
<samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> file.  The latter two are commonly used to turn version
control on or off.  Version control is on by default when saving the
startup files.  If you want to turn backup creation off, say something like:

<pre class="lisp">     (defun turn-off-backup ()
       (set (make-local-variable 'backup-inhibited) t))
     
     (add-hook 'gnus-save-quick-newsrc-hook 'turn-off-backup)
     (add-hook 'gnus-save-standard-newsrc-hook 'turn-off-backup)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dinit_002dfile-49"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dsite_002dinit_002dfile-50"></a>When Gnus starts, it will read the <code>gnus-site-init-file</code>
(<samp><span class="file">.../site-lisp/gnus-init</span></samp> by default) and <code>gnus-init-file</code>
(<samp><span class="file">~/.gnus</span></samp> by default) files.  These are normal Emacs Lisp files
and can be used to avoid cluttering your <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">site-init</span></samp> files with Gnus stuff.  Gnus will also check for files
with the same names as these, but with <samp><span class="file">.elc</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp>
suffixes.  In other words, if you have set <code>gnus-init-file</code> to
<samp><span class="file">~/.gnus</span></samp>, it will look for <samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.elc</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp>,
and finally <samp><span class="file">~/.gnus</span></samp> (in this order).  If Emacs was invoked with
the <samp><span class="option">-q</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">--no-init-file</span></samp> options (see <a href="../emacs/Initial-Options.html#Initial-Options">Initial Options</a>), Gnus doesn't read
<code>gnus-init-file</code>.
