<h5 class="subsubsection">6.8.1.2 Running NNDiary</h5>

<p><a name="index-running-nndiary-2279"></a><a name="index-nndiary-operation-modes-2280"></a>
<code>nndiary</code> has two modes of operation: &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; (the default)
and &ldquo;autonomous&rdquo;.  In traditional mode, <code>nndiary</code> does not get new
mail by itself.  You have to move (<kbd>B m</kbd>) or copy (<kbd>B c</kbd>) mails
from your primary mail back end to nndiary groups in order to handle them
as diary messages.  In autonomous mode, <code>nndiary</code> retrieves its own
mail and handles it independently from your primary mail back end.

   <p>One should note that Gnus is not inherently designed to allow several
&ldquo;master&rdquo; mail back ends at the same time.  However, this does make
sense with <code>nndiary</code>: you really want to send and receive diary
messages to your diary groups directly.  So, <code>nndiary</code> supports
being sort of a &ldquo;second primary mail back end&rdquo; (to my knowledge, it is
the only back end offering this feature).  However, there is a limitation
(which I hope to fix some day): respooling doesn't work in autonomous
mode.

   <p>In order to use <code>nndiary</code> in autonomous mode, you have several
things to do:

     <ul>
<li>Allow <code>nndiary</code> to retrieve new mail by itself.  Put the following
line in your <samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp> file:

     <pre class="lisp">          (setq nndiary-get-new-mail t)
</pre>
     <li>You must arrange for diary messages (those containing <code>X-Diary-*</code>
headers) to be split in a private folder <em>before</em> Gnus treat them. 
Again, this is needed because Gnus cannot (yet ?) properly handle
multiple primary mail back ends.  Getting those messages from a separate
source will compensate this misfeature to some extent.

     <p>As an example, here's my procmailrc entry to store diary files in
<samp><span class="file">~/.nndiary</span></samp> (the default <code>nndiary</code> mail source file):

     <pre class="example">          :0 HD :
          * ^X-Diary
          .nndiary
</pre>
     </ul>

   <p>Once this is done, you might want to customize the following two options
that affect the diary mail retrieval and splitting processes:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>nndiary-mail-sources</b><var><a name="index-nndiary_002dmail_002dsources-2281"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is the diary-specific replacement for the standard
<code>mail-sources</code> variable.  It obeys the same syntax, and defaults to
<code>(file :path "~/.nndiary")</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>nndiary-split-methods</b><var><a name="index-nndiary_002dsplit_002dmethods-2282"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is the diary-specific replacement for the standard
<code>nnmail-split-methods</code> variable.  It obeys the same syntax. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Finally, you may add a permanent <code>nndiary</code> virtual server
(something like <code>(nndiary "diary")</code> should do) to your
<code>gnus-secondary-select-methods</code>.

   <p>Hopefully, almost everything (see the TODO section in
<samp><span class="file">nndiary.el</span></samp>) will work as expected when you restart Gnus: in
autonomous mode, typing <kbd>g</kbd> and <kbd>M-g</kbd> in the group buffer, will
also get your new diary mails and split them according to your
diary-specific rules, <kbd>F</kbd> will find your new diary groups etc.
