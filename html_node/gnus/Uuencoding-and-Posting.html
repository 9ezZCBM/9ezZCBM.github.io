<dt><code>gnus-uu-post-include-before-composing</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002duu_002dpost_002dinclude_002dbefore_002dcomposing-1196"></a>Non-<code>nil</code> means that <code>gnus-uu</code> will ask for a file to encode
before you compose the article.  If this variable is <code>t</code>, you can
either include an encoded file with <kbd>C-c C-i</kbd> or have one included
for you when you post the article.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-uu-post-length</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002duu_002dpost_002dlength-1197"></a>Maximum length of an article.  The encoded file will be split into how
many articles it takes to post the entire file.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-uu-post-threaded</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002duu_002dpost_002dthreaded-1198"></a>Non-<code>nil</code> means that <code>gnus-uu</code> will post the encoded file in a
thread.  This may not be smart, as no other decoder I have seen is able
to follow threads when collecting uuencoded articles.  (Well, I have
seen one package that does that&mdash;<code>gnus-uu</code>, but somehow, I don't
think that counts<small class="dots">...</small>) Default is <code>nil</code>.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-uu-post-separate-description</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002duu_002dpost_002dseparate_002ddescription-1199"></a>Non-<code>nil</code> means that the description will be posted in a separate
article.  The first article will typically be numbered (0/x).  If this
variable is <code>nil</code>, the description the user enters will be included
at the beginning of the first article, which will be numbered (1/x). 
Default is <code>t</code>.
