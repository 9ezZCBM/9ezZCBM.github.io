<p><a name="index-mode-lines-2893"></a><a name="index-highlights-2894"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><code>gnus-home-directory</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dhome_002ddirectory-2895"></a>All Gnus file and directory variables will be initialized from this
variable, which defaults to <samp><span class="file">~/</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-directory</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002ddirectory-2896"></a>Most Gnus storage file and directory variables will be initialized from
this variable, which defaults to the <samp><span class="env">SAVEDIR</span></samp> environment
variable, or <samp><span class="file">~/News/</span></samp> if that variable isn't set.

     <p>Note that Gnus is mostly loaded when the <samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp> file is read. 
This means that other directory variables that are initialized from this
variable won't be set properly if you set this variable in
<samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp>.  Set this variable in <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> instead.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-default-directory</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002ddefault_002ddirectory-2897"></a>Not related to the above variable at all&mdash;this variable says what the
default directory of all Gnus buffers should be.  If you issue commands
like <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>, the prompt you'll get starts in the current buffer's
default directory.  If this variable is <code>nil</code> (which is the
default), the default directory will be the default directory of the
buffer you were in when you started Gnus.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-verbose</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dverbose-2898"></a>This variable is an integer between zero and ten.  The higher the value,
the more messages will be displayed.  If this variable is zero, Gnus
will never flash any messages, if it is seven (which is the default),
most important messages will be shown, and if it is ten, Gnus won't ever
shut up, but will flash so many messages it will make your head swim.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-verbose-backends</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dverbose_002dbackends-2899"></a>This variable works the same way as <code>gnus-verbose</code>, but it applies
to the Gnus back ends instead of Gnus proper.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-add-timestamp-to-message</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dadd_002dtimestamp_002dto_002dmessage-2900"></a>This variable controls whether to add timestamps to messages that are
controlled by <code>gnus-verbose</code> and <code>gnus-verbose-backends</code> and
are issued.  The default value is <code>nil</code> which means never to add
timestamp.  If it is <code>log</code>, add timestamps to only the messages
that go into the <samp><span class="file">*Messages*</span></samp> buffer (in XEmacs, it is the
<samp><span class="file">&nbsp;*Message-Log*</span></samp><!-- /@w --> buffer).  If it is neither <code>nil</code> nor
<code>log</code>, add timestamps not only to log messages but also to the ones
displayed in the echo area.

     <br><dt><code>nnheader-max-head-length</code><dd><a name="index-nnheader_002dmax_002dhead_002dlength-2901"></a>When the back ends read straight heads of articles, they all try to read
as little as possible.  This variable (default 8192) specifies
the absolute max length the back ends will try to read before giving up
on finding a separator line between the head and the body.  If this
variable is <code>nil</code>, there is no upper read bound.  If it is
<code>t</code>, the back ends won't try to read the articles piece by piece,
but read the entire articles.  This makes sense with some versions of
<code>ange-ftp</code> or <code>efs</code>.

     <br><dt><code>nnheader-head-chop-length</code><dd><a name="index-nnheader_002dhead_002dchop_002dlength-2902"></a>This variable (default 2048) says how big a piece of each article to
read when doing the operation described above.

     <br><dt><code>nnheader-file-name-translation-alist</code><dd><a name="index-nnheader_002dfile_002dname_002dtranslation_002dalist-2903"></a><a name="index-file-names-2904"></a><a name="index-invalid-characters-in-file-names-2905"></a><a name="index-characters-in-file-names-2906"></a>This is an alist that says how to translate characters in file names. 
For instance, if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo; is invalid as a file character in file names
on your system (you MS Windows user you), you could say something like:

     <pre class="lisp">          (setq nnheader-file-name-translation-alist
                '((?: . ?_)))
</pre>
     <p>In fact, this is (part of) the default value for this variable on MS
Windows (phooey) systems.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-hidden-properties</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dhidden_002dproperties-2907"></a>This is a list of properties to use to hide &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; text.  It is
<code>(invisible t intangible t)</code> by default on most systems, which
makes invisible text invisible and intangible.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-parse-headers-hook</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dparse_002dheaders_002dhook-2908"></a>A hook called before parsing headers.  It can be used, for instance, to
gather statistics on the headers fetched, or perhaps you'd like to prune
some headers.  I don't see why you'd want that, though.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-shell-command-separator</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dshell_002dcommand_002dseparator-2909"></a>String used to separate two shell commands.  The default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-invalid-group-regexp</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dinvalid_002dgroup_002dregexp-2910"></a>
Regexp to match &ldquo;invalid&rdquo; group names when querying user for a group
name.  The default value catches some <strong>really</strong> invalid group
names who could possibly mess up Gnus internally (like allowing
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo; in a group name, which is normally used to delimit method and
group).

     <p><acronym>IMAP</acronym> users might want to allow &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo; in group names though.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-safe-html-newsgroups</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dsafe_002dhtml_002dnewsgroups-2911"></a>Groups in which links in html articles are considered all safe.  The
value may be a regexp matching those groups, a list of group names, or
<code>nil</code>.  This overrides <code>mm-w3m-safe-url-regexp</code>.  The default
value is <code>"\\`nnrss[+:]"</code>.  This is effective only when emacs-w3m
renders html articles, i.e., in the case <code>mm-text-html-renderer</code> is
set to <code>w3m</code>.  See <a href="../emacs-mime/Display-Customization.html#Display-Customization">Display Customization</a>.
