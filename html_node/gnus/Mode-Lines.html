<h3 class="section">9.7 Mode Lines</h3>

<p><a name="index-mode-lines-2609"></a>
<a name="index-gnus_002dupdated_002dmode_002dlines-2610"></a><code>gnus-updated-mode-lines</code> says what buffers should keep their mode
lines updated.  It is a list of symbols.  Supported symbols include
<code>group</code>, <code>article</code>, <code>summary</code>, <code>server</code>,
<code>browse</code>, and <code>tree</code>.  If the corresponding symbol is present,
Gnus will keep that mode line updated with information that may be
pertinent.  If this variable is <code>nil</code>, screen refresh may be
quicker.

   <p><a name="index-display_002dtime-2611"></a>
<a name="index-gnus_002dmode_002dnon_002dstring_002dlength-2612"></a>By default, Gnus displays information on the current article in the mode
lines of the summary and article buffers.  The information Gnus wishes
to display (e.g., the subject of the article) is often longer than the
mode lines, and therefore have to be cut off at some point.  The
<code>gnus-mode-non-string-length</code> variable says how long the other
elements on the line is (i.e., the non-info part).  If you put
additional elements on the mode line (e.g., a clock), you should modify
this variable:

<!-- Hook written by Francesco PotortÃ¬ <pot@cnuce.cnr.it> -->
<pre class="lisp">     (add-hook 'display-time-hook
               (lambda () (setq gnus-mode-non-string-length
                                (+ 21
                                   (if line-number-mode 5 0)
                                   (if column-number-mode 4 0)
                                   (length display-time-string)))))
</pre>
   <p>If this variable is <code>nil</code> (which is the default), the mode line
strings won't be chopped off, and they won't be padded either.  Note
that the default is unlikely to be desirable, as even the percentage
complete in the buffer may be crowded off the mode line; the user should
configure this variable appropriately for her configuration.
