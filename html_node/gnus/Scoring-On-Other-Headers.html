<h3 class="section">7.9 Scoring On Other Headers</h3>

<p><a name="index-scoring-on-other-headers-2492"></a>
Gnus is quite fast when scoring the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo;
headers&mdash;&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">From</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Subject</span></samp>&rsquo; and so on.  However, scoring
other headers requires writing a <code>head</code> scoring rule, which means
that Gnus has to request every single article from the back end to find
matches.  This takes a long time in big groups.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dinhibit_002dslow_002dscoring-2493"></a>You can inhibit this slow scoring on headers or body by setting the
variable <code>gnus-inhibit-slow-scoring</code>.  If
<code>gnus-inhibit-slow-scoring</code> is regexp, slow scoring is inhibited if
the group matches the regexp.  If it is <code>t</code>, slow scoring on it is
inhibited for all groups.

   <p>Now, there's not much you can do about the slowness for news groups, but for
mail groups, you have greater control.  In <a href="To-From-Newsgroups.html#To-From-Newsgroups">To From Newsgroups</a>,
it's explained in greater detail what this mechanism does, but here's
a cookbook example for <code>nnml</code> on how to allow scoring on the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">To</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Cc</span></samp>&rsquo; headers.

   <p>Put the following in your <samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp> file.

<pre class="lisp">     (setq gnus-extra-headers '(To Cc Newsgroups Keywords)
           nnmail-extra-headers gnus-extra-headers)
</pre>
   <p>Restart Gnus and rebuild your <code>nnml</code> overview files with the
<kbd>M-x nnml-generate-nov-databases</kbd> command.  This will take a long
time if you have much mail.

   <p>Now you can score on &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">To</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Cc</span></samp>&rsquo; as &ldquo;extra headers&rdquo; like
so: <kbd>I e s p To &lt;RET&gt; &lt;your name&gt; &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.

   <p>See?  Simple.
