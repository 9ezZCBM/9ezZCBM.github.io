<p>New features in Gnus 5.4/5.5:

     <ul>
<li><samp><span class="file">nntp.el</span></samp> has been totally rewritten in an asynchronous fashion.

     <li>Article prefetching functionality has been moved up into
Gnus (see <a href="Asynchronous-Fetching.html#Asynchronous-Fetching">Asynchronous Fetching</a>).

     <li>Scoring can now be performed with logical operators like <code>and</code>,
<code>or</code>, <code>not</code>, and parent redirection (see <a href="Advanced-Scoring.html#Advanced-Scoring">Advanced Scoring</a>).

     <li>Article washing status can be displayed in the
article mode line (see <a href="Misc-Article.html#Misc-Article">Misc Article</a>).

     <li><samp><span class="file">gnus.el</span></samp> has been split into many smaller files.

     <li>Suppression of duplicate articles based on Message-ID can be done
(see <a href="Duplicate-Suppression.html#Duplicate-Suppression">Duplicate Suppression</a>).

     <pre class="lisp">          (setq gnus-suppress-duplicates t)
</pre>
     <li>New variables for specifying what score and adapt files are to be
considered home score and adapt files (see <a href="Home-Score-File.html#Home-Score-File">Home Score File</a>) have
been added.

     <li><code>nndoc</code> was rewritten to be easily extensible (see <a href="Document-Server-Internals.html#Document-Server-Internals">Document Server Internals</a>).

     <li>Groups can inherit group parameters from parent topics (see <a href="Topic-Parameters.html#Topic-Parameters">Topic Parameters</a>).

     <li>Article editing has been revamped and is now actually usable.

     <li>Signatures can be recognized in more intelligent fashions
(see <a href="Article-Signature.html#Article-Signature">Article Signature</a>).

     <li>Summary pick mode has been made to look more <code>nn</code>-like.  Line
numbers are displayed and the <kbd>.</kbd> command can be used to pick
articles (<code>Pick and Read</code>).

     <li>Commands for moving the <samp><span class="file">.newsrc.eld</span></samp> from one server to
another have been added (see <a href="Changing-Servers.html#Changing-Servers">Changing Servers</a>).

     <li>There's a way now to specify that &ldquo;uninteresting&rdquo; fields be suppressed
when generating lines in buffers (see <a href="Advanced-Formatting.html#Advanced-Formatting">Advanced Formatting</a>).

     <li>Several commands in the group buffer can be undone with <kbd>C-M-_</kbd>
(see <a href="Undo.html#Undo">Undo</a>).

     <li>Scoring can be done on words using the new score type <code>w</code>
(see <a href="Score-File-Format.html#Score-File-Format">Score File Format</a>).

     <li>Adaptive scoring can be done on a Subject word-by-word basis
(see <a href="Adaptive-Scoring.html#Adaptive-Scoring">Adaptive Scoring</a>).

     <pre class="lisp">          (setq gnus-use-adaptive-scoring '(word))
</pre>
     <li>Scores can be decayed (see <a href="Score-Decays.html#Score-Decays">Score Decays</a>).

     <pre class="lisp">          (setq gnus-decay-scores t)
</pre>
     <li>Scoring can be performed using a regexp on the Date header.  The Date is
normalized to compact ISO 8601 format first (see <a href="Score-File-Format.html#Score-File-Format">Score File Format</a>).

     <li>A new command has been added to remove all data on articles from
the native server (see <a href="Changing-Servers.html#Changing-Servers">Changing Servers</a>).

     <li>A new command for reading collections of documents
(<code>nndoc</code> with <code>nnvirtual</code> on top) has been added&mdash;<kbd>C-M-d</kbd>
(see <a href="Really-Various-Summary-Commands.html#Really-Various-Summary-Commands">Really Various Summary Commands</a>).

(see <a href="Web-Searches.html#Web-Searches">Web Searches</a>).

functions, and each topic can be sorted independently (see <a href="Topic-Sorting.html#Topic-Sorting">Topic Sorting</a>).

     <li>Subsets of the groups can be sorted independently (<code>Sorting
Groups</code>).

     <li>Cached articles can be pulled into the groups (see <a href="Summary-Generation-Commands.html#Summary-Generation-Commands">Summary Generation Commands</a>).

     <li>Score files are now applied in a more reliable order (see <a href="Score-Variables.html#Score-Variables">Score Variables</a>).
