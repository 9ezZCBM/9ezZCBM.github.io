First, some background on spam.

   <p>If you have access to e-mail, you are familiar with spam (technically
termed <acronym>UCE</acronym>, Unsolicited Commercial E-mail).  Simply put, it
exists because e-mail delivery is very cheap compared to paper mail,
so only a very small percentage of people need to respond to an UCE to
make it worthwhile to the advertiser.  Ironically, one of the most
common spams is the one offering a database of e-mail addresses for
further spamming.  Senders of spam are usually called <em>spammers</em>,
but terms like <em>vermin</em>, <em>scum</em>, <em>sociopaths</em>, and
<em>morons</em> are in common use as well.

   <p>Spam comes from a wide variety of sources.  It is simply impossible to
dispose of all spam without discarding useful messages.  A good
example is the TMDA system, which requires senders
unknown to you to confirm themselves as legitimate senders before
their e-mail can reach you.  Without getting into the technical side
of TMDA, a downside is clearly that e-mail from legitimate sources may
be discarded if those sources can't or won't confirm themselves
through the TMDA system.  Another problem with TMDA is that it
requires its users to have a basic understanding of e-mail delivery
and processing.

   <p>The simplest approach to filtering spam is filtering, at the mail
server or when you sort through incoming mail.  If you get 200 spam
messages per day from &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">random-address@vmadmin.com</span></samp>&rsquo;, you block
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vmadmin.com</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If you get 200 messages about &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">VIAGRA</span></samp>&rsquo;, you
discard all messages with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">VIAGRA</span></samp>&rsquo; in the message.  If you get
lots of spam from Bulgaria, for example, you try to filter all mail
from Bulgarian IPs.

   <p>This, unfortunately, is a great way to discard legitimate e-mail.  The
risks of blocking a whole country (Bulgaria, Norway, Nigeria, China,
etc.) or even a continent (Asia, Africa, Europe, etc.) from contacting
you should be obvious, so don't do it if you have the choice.

   <p>In another instance, the very informative and useful RISKS digest has
been blocked by overzealous mail filters because it <strong>contained</strong>
words that were common in spam messages.  Nevertheless, in isolated
cases, with great care, direct filtering of mail can be useful.

   <p>Another approach to filtering e-mail is the distributed spam
processing, for instance DCC implements such a system.  In essence,
<var>N</var> systems around the world agree that a machine <var>X</var> in
Ghana, Estonia, or California is sending out spam e-mail, and these
<var>N</var> systems enter <var>X</var> or the spam e-mail from <var>X</var> into a
database.  The criteria for spam detection vary&mdash;it may be the number
of messages sent, the content of the messages, and so on.  When a user
of the distributed processing system wants to find out if a message is
spam, he consults one of those <var>N</var> systems.

   <p>Distributed spam processing works very well against spammers that send
a large number of messages at once, but it requires the user to set up
fairly complicated checks.  There are commercial and free distributed
spam processing systems.  Distributed spam processing has its risks as
well.  For instance legitimate e-mail senders have been accused of
sending spam, and their web sites and mailing lists have been shut
down for some time because of the incident.

   <p>The statistical approach to spam filtering is also popular.  It is
based on a statistical analysis of previous spam messages.  Usually
the analysis is a simple word frequency count, with perhaps pairs of
words or 3-word combinations thrown into the mix.  Statistical
analysis of spam works very well in most of the cases, but it can
classify legitimate e-mail as spam in some cases.  It takes time to
run the analysis, the full message must be analyzed, and the user has
to store the database of spam analysis.  Statistical analysis on the
server is gaining popularity.  This has the advantage of letting the
user Just Read Mail, but has the disadvantage that it's harder to tell
the server that it has misclassified mail.

   <p>Fighting spam is not easy, no matter what anyone says.  There is no
magic switch that will distinguish Viagra ads from Mom's e-mails. 
Even people are having a hard time telling spam apart from non-spam,
because spammers are actively looking to fool us into thinking they
are Mom, essentially.  Spamming is irritating, irresponsible, and
idiotic behavior from a bunch of people who think the world owes them
a favor.  We hope the following sections will help you in fighting the
spam plague.
