<h3 class="section">3.13 Persistent Articles</h3>

<p><a name="index-persistent-articles-1061"></a>
Closely related to article caching, we have <dfn>persistent articles</dfn>. 
In fact, it's just a different way of looking at caching, and much more
useful in my opinion.

   <p>Say you're reading a newsgroup, and you happen on to some valuable gem
that you want to keep and treasure forever.  You'd normally just save it
(using one of the many saving commands) in some file.  The problem with
that is that it's just, well, yucky.  Ideally you'd prefer just having
the article remain in the group where you found it forever; untouched by
the expiry going on at the news server.

   <p>This is what a <dfn>persistent article</dfn> is&mdash;an article that just won't
be deleted.  It's implemented using the normal cache functions, but
you use two explicit commands for managing persistent articles:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>*</kbd><dd><a name="index-g_t_002a-_0040r_007b_0028Summary_0029_007d-1062"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dcache_002denter_002darticle-1063"></a>Make the current article persistent (<code>gnus-cache-enter-article</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>M-*</kbd><dd><a name="index-M_002d_002a-_0040r_007b_0028Summary_0029_007d-1064"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dcache_002dremove_002darticle-1065"></a>Remove the current article from the persistent articles
(<code>gnus-cache-remove-article</code>).  This will normally delete the
article. 
</dl>

   <p>Both these commands understand the process/prefix convention.

   <p>To avoid having all ticked articles (and stuff) entered into the cache,
you should set <code>gnus-use-cache</code> to <code>passive</code> if you're just
interested in persistent articles:

<pre class="lisp">     (setq gnus-use-cache 'passive)
</pre>
   </body></html>
