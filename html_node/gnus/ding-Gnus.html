<h5 class="subsubsection">11.2.8.1 (ding) Gnus</h5>

<p>New features in Gnus 5.0/5.1:

     <ul>
<li>The look of all buffers can be changed by setting format-like variables
(see <a href="Group-Buffer-Format.html#Group-Buffer-Format">Group Buffer Format</a> and see <a href="Summary-Buffer-Format.html#Summary-Buffer-Format">Summary Buffer Format</a>).

     <li>Local spool and several <acronym>NNTP</acronym> servers can be used at once
(see <a href="Select-Methods.html#Select-Methods">Select Methods</a>).

     <li>You can combine groups into virtual groups (see <a href="Virtual-Groups.html#Virtual-Groups">Virtual Groups</a>).

     <li>You can read a number of different mail formats (see <a href="Getting-Mail.html#Getting-Mail">Getting Mail</a>). 
All the mail back ends implement a convenient mail expiry scheme
(see <a href="Expiring-Mail.html#Expiring-Mail">Expiring Mail</a>).

     <li>Gnus can use various strategies for gathering threads that have lost
their roots (thereby gathering loose sub-threads into one thread) or it
can go back and retrieve enough headers to build a complete thread
(see <a href="Customizing-Threading.html#Customizing-Threading">Customizing Threading</a>).

     <li>Killed groups can be displayed in the group buffer, and you can read
them as well (see <a href="Listing-Groups.html#Listing-Groups">Listing Groups</a>).

     <li>Gnus can do partial group updates&mdash;you do not have to retrieve the
entire active file just to check for new articles in a few groups
(see <a href="The-Active-File.html#The-Active-File">The Active File</a>).

     <li>Gnus implements a sliding scale of subscribedness to groups
(see <a href="Group-Levels.html#Group-Levels">Group Levels</a>).

     <li>You can score articles according to any number of criteria
(see <a href="Scoring.html#Scoring">Scoring</a>).  You can even get Gnus to find out how to score
articles for you (see <a href="Adaptive-Scoring.html#Adaptive-Scoring">Adaptive Scoring</a>).

     <li>Gnus maintains a dribble buffer that is auto-saved the normal Emacs
manner, so it should be difficult to lose much data on what you have
read if your machine should go down (see <a href="Auto-Save.html#Auto-Save">Auto Save</a>).

     <li>Gnus now has its own startup file (<samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp>) to avoid
cluttering up the <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.

     <li>You can set the process mark on both groups and articles and perform
operations on all the marked items (see <a href="Process_002fPrefix.html#Process_002fPrefix">Process/Prefix</a>).

     <li>You can list subsets of groups according to, well, anything
(see <a href="Listing-Groups.html#Listing-Groups">Listing Groups</a>).

     <li>You can browse foreign servers and subscribe to groups from those
servers (see <a href="Browse-Foreign-Server.html#Browse-Foreign-Server">Browse Foreign Server</a>).

     <li>Gnus can fetch articles, asynchronously, on a second connection to the
server (see <a href="Asynchronous-Fetching.html#Asynchronous-Fetching">Asynchronous Fetching</a>).

     <li>You can cache articles locally (see <a href="Article-Caching.html#Article-Caching">Article Caching</a>).

     <li>The uudecode functions have been expanded and generalized
(see <a href="Decoding-Articles.html#Decoding-Articles">Decoding Articles</a>).

     <li>You can still post uuencoded articles, which was a little-known feature
of <span class="sc">gnus</span>' past (see <a href="Uuencoding-and-Posting.html#Uuencoding-and-Posting">Uuencoding and Posting</a>).

     <li>Fetching parents (and other articles) now actually works without
glitches (see <a href="Finding-the-Parent.html#Finding-the-Parent">Finding the Parent</a>).

     <li>Gnus can fetch <acronym>FAQ</acronym>s and group descriptions (see <a href="Group-Information.html#Group-Information">Group Information</a>).

     <li>Digests (and other files) can be used as the basis for groups
(see <a href="Document-Groups.html#Document-Groups">Document Groups</a>).

     <li>Articles can be highlighted and customized (see <a href="Customizing-Articles.html#Customizing-Articles">Customizing Articles</a>).

     <li>URLs and other external references can be buttonized (see <a href="Article-Buttons.html#Article-Buttons">Article Buttons</a>).

     <li>You can do lots of strange stuff with the Gnus window &amp; frame
configuration (see <a href="Window-Layout.html#Window-Layout">Window Layout</a>).

   </ul>
