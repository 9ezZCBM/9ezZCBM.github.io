<h4 class="subsection">9.4.1 Formatting Basics</h4>

<p>Each &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; element will be replaced by some string or other when the
buffer in question is generated.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%5y</span></samp>&rsquo; means &ldquo;insert the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;
spec, and pad with spaces to get a 5-character field&rdquo;.

   <p>As with normal C and Emacs Lisp formatting strings, the numerical
modifier between the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; and the formatting type character will
<dfn>pad</dfn> the output so that it is always at least that long. 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%5y</span></samp>&rsquo; will make the field always (at least) five characters wide by
padding with spaces to the left.  If you say &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%-5y</span></samp>&rsquo;, it will pad to
the right instead.

   <p>You may also wish to limit the length of the field to protect against
particularly wide values.  For that you can say &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%4,6y</span></samp>&rsquo;, which
means that the field will never be more than 6 characters wide and never
less than 4 characters wide.

   <p>Also Gnus supports some extended format specifications, such as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%&amp;user-date;</span></samp>&rsquo;.
