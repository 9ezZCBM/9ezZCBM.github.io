<h3 class="section">11.2 History</h3>

<p><a name="index-history-2914"></a><span class="sc">gnus</span> was written by Masanobu <span class="sc">Umeda</span>.  When autumn crept up in
'94, Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen grew bored and decided to rewrite Gnus.

   <p>If you want to investigate the person responsible for this outrage,
you can point your (feh!) web browser to
<a href="http://quimby.gnus.org/">http://quimby.gnus.org/</a>.  This is also the primary
distribution point for the new and spiffy versions of Gnus, and is
known as The Site That Destroys Newsrcs And Drives People Mad.

   <p>During the first extended alpha period of development, the new Gnus was
called &ldquo;(ding) Gnus&rdquo;.  <dfn>(ding)</dfn> is, of course, short for
<dfn>ding is not Gnus</dfn>, which is a total and utter lie, but who cares? 
(Besides, the &ldquo;Gnus&rdquo; in this abbreviation should probably be
pronounced &ldquo;news&rdquo; as <span class="sc">Umeda</span> intended, which makes it a more
appropriate name, don't you think?)

   <p>In any case, after spending all that energy on coming up with a new and
spunky name, we decided that the name was <em>too</em> spunky, so we
renamed it back again to &ldquo;Gnus&rdquo;.  But in mixed case.  &ldquo;Gnus&rdquo; vs. 
&ldquo;<span class="sc">gnus</span>&rdquo;.  New vs. old.
