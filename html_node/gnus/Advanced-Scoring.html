<h3 class="section">7.15 Advanced Scoring</h3>

<p>Scoring on Subjects and From headers is nice enough, but what if you're
really interested in what a person has to say only when she's talking
about a particular subject?  Or what if you really don't want to
read what person A has to say when she's following up to person B, but
want to read what she says when she's following up to person C?

   <p>By using advanced scoring rules you may create arbitrarily complex
scoring patterns.
