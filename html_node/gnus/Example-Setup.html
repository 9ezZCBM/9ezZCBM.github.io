<h4 class="subsection">6.9.12 Example Setup</h4>

<p>If you don't want to read this manual, and you have a fairly standard
setup, you may be able to use something like the following as your
<samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp> file to get started.

<pre class="lisp">     ;; <span class="roman">Define how Gnus is to fetch news.  We do this over <acronym>NNTP</acronym></span>
     ;; <span class="roman">from your ISP's server.</span>
     (setq gnus-select-method '(nntp "news.your-isp.com"))
     
     ;; <span class="roman">Define how Gnus is to read your mail.  We read mail from</span>
     ;; <span class="roman">your ISP's <acronym>POP</acronym> server.</span>
     (setq mail-sources '((pop :server "pop.your-isp.com")))
     
     ;; <span class="roman">Say how Gnus is to store the mail.  We use nnml groups.</span>
     (setq gnus-secondary-select-methods '((nnml "")))
     
     ;; <span class="roman">Make Gnus into an offline newsreader.</span>
     ;; (gnus-agentize) ; <span class="roman">The obsolete setting.</span>
     ;; (setq gnus-agent t) ; <span class="roman">Now the default.</span>
</pre>
   <p>That should be it, basically.  Put that in your <samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp> file,
edit to suit your needs, start up PPP (or whatever), and type <kbd>M-x
gnus</kbd>.

   <p>If this is the first time you've run Gnus, you will be subscribed
automatically to a few default newsgroups.  You'll probably want to
subscribe to more groups, and to do that, you have to query the
<acronym>NNTP</acronym> server for a complete list of groups with the <kbd>A A</kbd>
command.  This usually takes quite a while, but you only have to do it
once.

   <p>After reading and parsing a while, you'll be presented with a list of
groups.  Subscribe to the ones you want to read with the <kbd>u</kbd>
command.  <kbd>l</kbd> to make all the killed groups disappear after you've
subscribe to all the groups you want to read.  (<kbd>A k</kbd> will bring
back all the killed groups.)

   <p>You can now read the groups at once, or you can download the articles
with the <kbd>J s</kbd> command.  And then read the rest of this manual to
find out which of the other gazillion things you want to customize.
