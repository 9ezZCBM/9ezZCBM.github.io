<h4 class="subsection">11.5.2 Slow Terminal Connection</h4>

<p>Let's say you use your home computer for dialing up the system that runs
Emacs and Gnus.  If your modem is slow, you want to reduce (as much as
possible) the amount of data sent over the wires.

     <dl>
<dt><code>gnus-auto-center-summary</code><dd>Set this to <code>nil</code> to inhibit Gnus from re-centering the summary
buffer all the time.  If it is <code>vertical</code>, do only vertical
re-centering.  If it is neither <code>nil</code> nor <code>vertical</code>, do both
horizontal and vertical recentering.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-visible-headers</code><dd>Cut down on the headers included in the articles to the
minimum.  You can, in fact, make do without them altogether&mdash;most of the
useful data is in the summary buffer, anyway.  Set this variable to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^NEVVVVER</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">From:</span></samp>&rsquo;, or whatever you feel you need.

     <p>Use the following to enable all the available hiding features:
     <pre class="lisp">          (setq gnus-treat-hide-headers 'head
                gnus-treat-hide-signature t
                gnus-treat-hide-citation t)
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>gnus-use-full-window</code><dd>By setting this to <code>nil</code>, you can make all the windows smaller. 
While this doesn't really cut down much generally, it means that you
have to see smaller portions of articles before deciding that you didn't
want to read them anyway.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-thread-hide-subtree</code><dd>If this is non-<code>nil</code>, all threads in the summary buffer will be
hidden initially.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-updated-mode-lines</code><dd>If this is <code>nil</code>, Gnus will not put information in the buffer mode
lines, which might save some time. 
</dl>
