<h3 class="section">7.12 Global Score Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-global-score-files-2498"></a>
Sure, other newsreaders have &ldquo;global kill files&rdquo;.  These are usually
nothing more than a single kill file that applies to all groups, stored
in the user's home directory.  Bah!  Puny, weak newsreaders!

   <p>What I'm talking about here are Global Score Files.  Score files from
all over the world, from users everywhere, uniting all nations in one
big, happy score file union!  Ange-score!  New and untested!

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dglobal_002dscore_002dfiles-2499"></a>All you have to do to use other people's score files is to set the
<code>gnus-global-score-files</code> variable.  One entry for each score file,
or each score file directory.  Gnus will decide by itself what score
files are applicable to which group.

   <p>To use the score file
<samp><span class="file">/ftp@ftp.gnus.org:/pub/larsi/ding/score/soc.motss.SCORE</span></samp> and
all score files in the <samp><span class="file">/ftp@ftp.some-where:/pub/score</span></samp> directory,
say this:

<pre class="lisp">     (setq gnus-global-score-files
           '("/ftp@ftp.gnus.org:/pub/larsi/ding/score/soc.motss.SCORE"
             "/ftp@ftp.some-where:/pub/score/"))
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dscore_002dsearch_002dglobal_002ddirectories-2500"></a>Simple, eh?  Directory names must end with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;.  These
directories are typically scanned only once during each Gnus session. 
If you feel the need to manually re-scan the remote directories, you can
use the <code>gnus-score-search-global-directories</code> command.

   <p>Note that, at present, using this option will slow down group entry
somewhat.  (That is&mdash;a lot.)

   <p>If you want to start maintaining score files for other people to use,
just put your score file up for anonymous ftp and announce it to the
world.  Become a retro-moderator!  Participate in the retro-moderator
wars sure to ensue, where retro-moderators battle it out for the
sympathy of the people, luring them to use their score files on false
premises!  Yay!  The net is saved!

   <p>Here are some tips for the would-be retro-moderator, off the top of my
head:

     <ul>
<li>Articles heavily crossposted are probably junk. 
<li>To lower a single inappropriate article, lower by <code>Message-ID</code>. 
<li>Particularly brilliant authors can be raised on a permanent basis. 
<li>Authors that repeatedly post off-charter for the group can safely be
lowered out of existence. 
<li>Set the <code>mark</code> and <code>expunge</code> atoms to obliterate the nastiest
articles completely.

     <li>Use expiring score entries to keep the size of the file down.  You
should probably have a long expiry period, though, as some sites keep
old articles for a long time. 
</ul>

<small class="dots">...</small><p>I wonder whether other newsreaders will support global score files
in the future.  <em>Snicker</em>.  Yup, any day now, newsreaders like Blue
Wave, xrn and 1stReader are bound to implement scoring.  Should we start
holding our breath yet?
