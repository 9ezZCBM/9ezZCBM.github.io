<h3 class="section">7.8 Followups To Yourself</h3>

<p>Gnus offers two commands for picking out the <code>Message-ID</code> header in
the current buffer.  Gnus will then add a score rule that scores using
this <code>Message-ID</code> on the <code>References</code> header of other
articles.  This will, in effect, increase the score of all articles that
respond to the article in the current buffer.  Quite useful if you want
to easily note when people answer what you've said.

     <dl>
<dt><code>gnus-score-followup-article</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dscore_002dfollowup_002darticle-2489"></a>This will add a score to articles that directly follow up your own
article.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-score-followup-thread</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dscore_002dfollowup_002dthread-2490"></a>This will add a score to all articles that appear in a thread &ldquo;below&rdquo;
your own article. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-message_002dsent_002dhook-2491"></a>These two functions are both primarily meant to be used in hooks like
<code>message-sent-hook</code>, like this:
<pre class="lisp">     (add-hook 'message-sent-hook 'gnus-score-followup-thread)
</pre>
   <p>If you look closely at your own <code>Message-ID</code>, you'll notice that
the first two or three characters are always the same.  Here's two of
mine:

<pre class="example">     &lt;x6u3u47icf.fsf@eyesore.no&gt;
     &lt;x6sp9o7ibw.fsf@eyesore.no&gt;
</pre>
   <p>So &ldquo;my&rdquo; ident on this machine is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x6</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This can be
exploited&mdash;the following rule will raise the score on all followups to
myself:

<pre class="lisp">     ("references"
      ("&lt;x6[0-9a-z]+\\.fsf\\(_-_\\)?@.*eyesore\\.no&gt;"
       1000 nil r))
</pre>
   <p>Whether it's the first two or first three characters that are &ldquo;yours&rdquo;
is system-dependent.
