     <dl>
<dt><code>gnus-load-hook</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dload_002dhook-60"></a>A hook run while Gnus is being loaded.  Note that this hook will
normally be run just once in each Emacs session, no matter how many
times you start Gnus.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-before-startup-hook</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dbefore_002dstartup_002dhook-61"></a>A hook called as the first thing when Gnus is started.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-before-resume-hook</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dbefore_002dresume_002dhook-62"></a>A hook called as the first thing when Gnus is resumed after a suspend.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-startup-hook</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dstartup_002dhook-63"></a>A hook run as the very last thing after starting up Gnus

     <br><dt><code>gnus-started-hook</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dstarted_002dhook-64"></a>A hook that is run as the very last thing after starting up Gnus
successfully.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-setup-news-hook</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dsetup_002dnews_002dhook-65"></a>A hook that is run after reading the <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> file(s), but before
generating the group buffer.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-check-bogus-newsgroups</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dcheck_002dbogus_002dnewsgroups-66"></a>If non-<code>nil</code>, Gnus will check for and delete all bogus groups at
startup.  A <dfn>bogus group</dfn> is a group that you have in your
<samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> file, but doesn't exist on the news server.  Checking for
bogus groups can take quite a while, so to save time and resources it's
best to leave this option off, and do the checking for bogus groups once
in a while from the group buffer instead (see <a href="Group-Maintenance.html#Group-Maintenance">Group Maintenance</a>).

     <br><dt><code>gnus-inhibit-startup-message</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dinhibit_002dstartup_002dmessage-67"></a>If non-<code>nil</code>, the startup message won't be displayed.  That way,
your boss might not notice as easily that you are reading news instead
of doing your job.  Note that this variable is used before
<samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp> is loaded, so it should be set in <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> instead.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-no-groups-message</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dno_002dgroups_002dmessage-68"></a>Message displayed by Gnus when no groups are available.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-use-backend-marks</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002duse_002dbackend_002dmarks-69"></a>If non-<code>nil</code>, Gnus will store article marks both in the
<samp><span class="file">.newsrc.eld</span></samp> file and in the backends.  This will slow down
group operation some.
