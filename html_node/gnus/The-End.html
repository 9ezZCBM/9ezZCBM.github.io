<h2 class="chapter">10 The End</h2>

<p>Well, that's the manual&mdash;you can get on with your life now.  Keep in
touch.  Say hello to your cats from me.

   <p>My <strong>ghod</strong>&mdash;I just can't stand goodbyes.  Sniffle.

   <p>Ol' Charles Reznikoff said it pretty well, so I leave the floor to him:

   <blockquote>
<strong>Te Deum</strong>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
Not because of victories <br>
I sing,<br>
having none,<br>
but for the common sunshine,<br>
the breeze,<br>
the largess of the spring.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
Not for victory<br>
but for the day's work done<br>
as well as I was able;<br>
not for a seat upon the dais<br>
but at the common table.<br>
</blockquote>
