First of all, you should know that there is a special buffer called
<samp><span class="file">*Server*</span></samp> that lists all the servers Gnus knows about.  You can
press <kbd>^</kbd> from the Group buffer to see it.  In the Server buffer,
you can press <kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> on a defined server to see all the groups it
serves (subscribed or not!).  You can also add or delete servers, edit
a foreign server's definition, agentize or de-agentize a server, and
do many other neat things.  See <a href="Server-Buffer.html#Server-Buffer">Server Buffer</a>. 
See <a href="Foreign-Groups.html#Foreign-Groups">Foreign Groups</a>.  See <a href="Agent-Basics.html#Agent-Basics">Agent Basics</a>.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dselect_002dmethod-5"></a><!-- @head -->
The <code>gnus-select-method</code> variable says where Gnus should look for
news.  This variable should be a list where the first element says
<dfn>how</dfn> and the second element says <dfn>where</dfn>.  This method is your
native method.  All groups not fetched with this method are
secondary or foreign groups.

   <p>For instance, if the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">news.somewhere.edu</span></samp>&rsquo; <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server is where
you want to get your daily dosage of news from, you'd say:

<pre class="lisp">     (setq gnus-select-method '(nntp "news.somewhere.edu"))
</pre>
   <p>If you want to read directly from the local spool, say:

<pre class="lisp">     (setq gnus-select-method '(nnspool ""))
</pre>
   <p>If you can use a local spool, you probably should, as it will almost
certainly be much faster.  But do not use the local spool if your
server is running Leafnode (which is a simple, standalone private news
server); in this case, use <code>(nntp "localhost")</code>.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dnntpserver_002dfile-6"></a><a name="index-NNTPSERVER-7"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040acronym_007bNNTP_007d-server-8"></a>If this variable is not set, Gnus will take a look at the
<samp><span class="env">NNTPSERVER</span></samp> environment variable.  If that variable isn't set,
Gnus will see whether <code>gnus-nntpserver-file</code>
(<samp><span class="file">/etc/nntpserver</span></samp> by default) has any opinions on the matter. 
If that fails as well, Gnus will try to use the machine running Emacs
as an <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server.  That's a long shot, though.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dgroup_002dbrowse_002dforeign_002dserver-9"></a><a name="index-B-_0040r_007b_0028Group_0029_007d-10"></a>However, if you use one <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server regularly and are just
interested in a couple of groups from a different server, you would be
better served by using the <kbd>B</kbd> command in the group buffer.  It will
let you have a look at what groups are available, and you can subscribe
to any of the groups you want to.  This also makes <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp>
maintenance much tidier.  See <a href="Foreign-Groups.html#Foreign-Groups">Foreign Groups</a>.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dsecondary_002dselect_002dmethods-11"></a><!-- @head -->
A slightly different approach to foreign groups is to set the
<code>gnus-secondary-select-methods</code> variable.  The select methods
listed in this variable are in many ways just as native as the
<code>gnus-select-method</code> server.  They will also be queried for active
files during startup (if that's required), and new newsgroups that
appear on these servers will be subscribed (or not) just as native
groups are.

   <p>For instance, if you use the <code>nnmbox</code> back end to read your mail,
you would typically set this variable to

<pre class="lisp">     (setq gnus-secondary-select-methods '((nnmbox "")))
</pre>
   </body></html>
