<h4 class="subsection">3.7.5 Generic Marking Commands</h4>

<p>Some people would like the command that ticks an article (<kbd>!</kbd>) to
go to the next article.  Others would like it to go to the next unread
article.  Yet others would like it to stay on the current article. 
And even though I haven't heard of anybody wanting it to go to the
previous (unread) article, I'm sure there are people that want that as
well.

   <p>Multiply these five behaviors with five different marking commands, and
you get a potentially complex set of variable to control what each
command should do.

   <p>To sidestep that mess, Gnus provides commands that do all these
different things.  They can be found on the <kbd>M M</kbd> map in the summary
buffer.  Type <kbd>M M C-h</kbd> to see them all&mdash;there are too many of them
to list in this manual.

   <p>While you can use these commands directly, most users would prefer
altering the summary mode keymap.  For instance, if you would like the
<kbd>!</kbd> command to go to the next article instead of the next unread
article, you could say something like:

<pre class="lisp">     (add-hook 'gnus-summary-mode-hook 'my-alter-summary-map)
     (defun my-alter-summary-map ()
       (local-set-key "!" 'gnus-summary-put-mark-as-ticked-next))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or

<pre class="lisp">     (defun my-alter-summary-map ()
       (local-set-key "!" "MM!n"))
</pre>
   </body></html>
