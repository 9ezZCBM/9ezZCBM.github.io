<h4 class="subsection">11.8.2 Emacs Lisp</h4>

<p>Emacs is the King of Editors because it's really a Lisp interpreter. 
Each and every key you tap runs some Emacs Lisp code snippet, and since
Emacs Lisp is an interpreted language, that means that you can configure
any key to run any arbitrary code.  You just, like, do it.

   <p>Gnus is written in Emacs Lisp, and is run as a bunch of interpreted
functions.  (These are byte-compiled for speed, but it's still
interpreted.)  If you decide that you don't like the way Gnus does
certain things, it's trivial to have it do something a different way. 
(Well, at least if you know how to write Lisp code.)  However, that's
beyond the scope of this manual, so we are simply going to talk about
some common constructs that you normally use in your <samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp>
file to customize Gnus.  (You can also use the <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> file, but
in order to set things of Gnus up, it is much better to use the
<samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp> file, See <a href="Startup-Files.html#Startup-Files">Startup Files</a>.)

   <p>If you want to set the variable <code>gnus-florgbnize</code> to four (4), you
write the following:

<pre class="lisp">     (setq gnus-florgbnize 4)
</pre>
   <p>This function (really &ldquo;special form&rdquo;) <code>setq</code> is the one that can
set a variable to some value.  This is really all you need to know.  Now
you can go and fill your <samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp> file with lots of these to
change how Gnus works.

   <p>If you have put that thing in your <samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp> file, it will be
read and <code>eval</code>ed (which is Lisp-ese for &ldquo;run&rdquo;) the next time you
start Gnus.  If you want to change the variable right away, simply say
<kbd>C-x C-e</kbd> after the closing parenthesis.  That will <code>eval</code> the
previous &ldquo;form&rdquo;, which is a simple <code>setq</code> statement here.

   <p>Go ahead&mdash;just try it, if you're located at your Emacs.  After you
<kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>, you will see &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">4</span></samp>&rsquo; appear in the echo area, which
is the return value of the form you <code>eval</code>ed.

   <p>Some pitfalls:

   <p>If the manual says &ldquo;set <code>gnus-read-active-file</code> to <code>some</code>&rdquo;,
that means:

<pre class="lisp">     (setq gnus-read-active-file 'some)
</pre>
   <p>On the other hand, if the manual says &ldquo;set <code>gnus-nntp-server-file</code> to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/etc/nntpserver</span></samp>&rsquo;&rdquo;, that means:

<pre class="lisp">     (setq gnus-nntp-server-file "/etc/nntpserver")
</pre>
   <p>So be careful not to mix up strings (the latter) with symbols (the
former).  The manual is unambiguous, but it can be confusing.
