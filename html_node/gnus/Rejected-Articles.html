<h3 class="section">5.8 Rejected Articles</h3>

<p><a name="index-rejected-articles-1913"></a>
Sometimes a news server will reject an article.  Perhaps the server
doesn't like your face.  Perhaps it just feels miserable.  Perhaps
<em>there be demons</em>.  Perhaps you have included too much cited text. 
Perhaps the disk is full.  Perhaps the server is down.

   <p>These situations are, of course, totally beyond the control of Gnus. 
(Gnus, of course, loves the way you look, always feels great, has angels
fluttering around inside of it, doesn't care about how much cited text
you include, never runs full and never goes down.)  So Gnus saves these
articles until some later time when the server feels better.

   <p>The rejected articles will automatically be put in a special draft group
(see <a href="Drafts.html#Drafts">Drafts</a>).  When the server comes back up again, you'd then
typically enter that group and send all the articles off.
