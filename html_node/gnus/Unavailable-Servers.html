<h4 class="subsection">6.1.7 Unavailable Servers</h4>

<p>If a server seems to be unreachable, Gnus will mark that server as
<code>denied</code>.  That means that any subsequent attempt to make contact
with that server will just be ignored.  &ldquo;It can't be opened,&rdquo; Gnus
will tell you, without making the least effort to see whether that is
actually the case or not.

   <p>That might seem quite naughty, but it does make sense most of the time. 
Let's say you have 10 groups subscribed to on server
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nephelococcygia.com</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This server is located somewhere quite far
away from you and the machine is quite slow, so it takes 1 minute just
to find out that it refuses connection to you today.  If Gnus were to
attempt to do that 10 times, you'd be quite annoyed, so Gnus won't
attempt to do that.  Once it has gotten a single &ldquo;connection refused&rdquo;,
it will regard that server as &ldquo;down&rdquo;.

   <p>So, what happens if the machine was only feeling unwell temporarily? 
How do you test to see whether the machine has come up again?

   <p>You jump to the server buffer (see <a href="Server-Buffer.html#Server-Buffer">Server Buffer</a>) and poke it
with the following commands:

     <dl>

(<code>gnus-server-open-server</code>).

(<code>gnus-server-close-server</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>D</kbd><dd><a name="index-D-_0040r_007b_0028Server_0029_007d-1975"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dserver_002ddeny_002dserver-1976"></a>Mark the current server as unreachable
(<code>gnus-server-deny-server</code>).  This will effectively disable the
server.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-o</kbd><dd><a name="index-M_002do-_0040r_007b_0028Server_0029_007d-1977"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dserver_002dopen_002dall_002dservers-1978"></a>Open the connections to all servers in the buffer
(<code>gnus-server-open-all-servers</code>).

(<code>gnus-server-remove-denials</code>).

(<code>gnus-server-copy-server</code>).  This can be useful if you have a
complex method definition, and want to use the same definition towards
a different (physical) server.

     <br><dt><kbd>L</kbd><dd><a name="index-L-_0040r_007b_0028Server_0029_007d-1985"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dserver_002doffline_002dserver-1986"></a>Set server status to offline (<code>gnus-server-offline-server</code>).
