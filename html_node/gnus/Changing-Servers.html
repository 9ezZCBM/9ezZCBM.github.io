<h3 class="section">1.5 Changing Servers</h3>

<p><a name="index-changing-servers-33"></a>
Sometimes it is necessary to move from one <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server to another. 
This happens very rarely, but perhaps you change jobs, or one server is
very flaky and you want to use another.

   <p>Changing the server is pretty easy, right?  You just change
<code>gnus-select-method</code> to point to the new server?

   <p><em>Wrong!</em>

   <p>Article numbers are not (in any way) kept synchronized between different
<acronym>NNTP</acronym> servers, and the only way Gnus keeps track of what articles
you have read is by keeping track of article numbers.  So when you
change <code>gnus-select-method</code>, your <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> file becomes
worthless.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dgroup_002dclear_002ddata_002don_002dnative_002dgroups-34"></a>You can use the <kbd>M-x gnus-group-clear-data-on-native-groups</kbd>
command to clear out all data that you have on your native groups. 
Use with caution.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dgroup_002dclear_002ddata-35"></a>Clear the data from the current group only&mdash;nix out marks and the
list of read articles (<code>gnus-group-clear-data</code>).

   <p>After changing servers, you <strong>must</strong> move the cache hierarchy away,
since the cached articles will have wrong article numbers, which will
affect which articles Gnus thinks are read. 
<code>gnus-group-clear-data-on-native-groups</code> will ask you if you want
to have it done automatically; for <code>gnus-group-clear-data</code>, you
can use <kbd>M-x gnus-cache-move-cache</kbd> (but beware, it will move the
cache for all groups).
